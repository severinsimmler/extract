TO O -
THE B-PER -
REV. I-PER -
MR. B-PER (1
VILLARS O -
Howard O -

Kent O -
. O -

CAN O -
any O -
thing O -
, O -
my B-PER (1|(0)
good I-PER -
Sir I-PER 1)
, O -
be O -
more O -
painful O -
to O -
a O -
friendly O -
mind O -
, O -
than O -
a O -
necessity O -
of O -
communicating O -
disagreeable O -
intelligence O -
? O -

Indeed O -
it O -
is O -
sometimes O -
difficult O -
to O -
determine O -
, O -
whether O -
the B-PER (4
relator I-PER 4)
or O -
the B-PER (5
receiver I-PER -
of I-PER -
evil I-PER -
tidings I-PER 5)
is O -
most O -
to O -
be O -
pitied O -
. O -

I O -
have O -
just O -
had O -
a O -
letter O -
from O -
Madame B-PER (6
Duval O -
; O -
she O -
is O -
totally O -
at O -
a O -
loss O -
in O -
what O -
manner O -
to O -
behave O -
; O -
she O -
seems O -
desirous O -
to O -
repair O -
the O -
wrongs O -
she O -
has O -
done O -
, O -
yet O -
wishes O -
the O -
world O -
to O -
believe O -
her O -
blameless O -
. O -

She O -
would O -
fain O -
cast O -
upon O -
another O -
the O -
odium O -
of O -
those O -
misfortunes O -
for O -
which O -
she O -
alone O -
is O -
answerable O -
. O -

Her O -
letter O -
is O -
violent O -
, O -
sometimes O -
abusive O -
, O -
and O -
that O -
of O -
you O -
! O -

- O -
you O -
, O -
to O -
whom O -
she O -
is O -
under O -
obligations O -
which O -
are O -
greater O -
even O -
than O -
her O -
faults O -
, O -
but O -
to O -
whose O -
advice O -
she O -
wickedly O -
imputes O -
all O -
the O -
sufferings O -
of O -
her B-PER (8|(6)
much I-PER -
injured I-PER -
daughter I-PER 8)
, O -
the B-PER (17
late I-PER -
Lady I-PER -
Belmont I-PER 17)
. O -

The O -
chief O -
purport O -
of O -
her O -
writing O -
I O -
will O -
acquaint O -
you O -
with O -
; O -
the O -
letter O -
itself O -
is O -
not O -
worthy O -
your O -
notice O -
. O -

She O -
tells O -
me O -
that O -
she O -
has O -
, O -
for O -
many O -
years O -
past O -
, O -
been O -
in O -
continual O -
expectation O -
of O -
making O -
a O -
journey O -
to O -
England O -
, O -
which O -
prevented O -
her O -
writing O -
for O -
information O -
concerning O -
this O -
melancholy O -
subject O -
, O -
by O -
giving O -
her O -
hopes O -
of O -
making O -
personal O -
inquiries O -
; O -
but O -
family O -
occurrences O -
have O -
still O -
detained O -
her O -
in O -
France O -
, O -
which O -
country O -
she O -
now O -
sees O -
no O -
prospect O -
of O -
quitting O -
. O -

She O -
has O -
, O -
therefore O -
, O -
lately O -
used O -
her O -
utmost O -
endeavors O -
to O -
obtain O -
a O -
faithful O -
account O -
of O -
whatever O -
related O -
to O -
her B-PER (17|(6)
ill-advised I-PER -
daughter I-PER 17)
; O -
the O -
result O -
of O -
which O -
giving O -
her O -
some O -
reason O -
to O -
apprehend O -
, O -
that O -
, O -
upon O -
her O -
death-bed O -
, O -
she O -
bequeathed O -
an B-PER (45
infant I-PER -
orphan I-PER 45)
to O -
the O -
world O -
, O -
she O -
most O -
graciously O -
says O -
, O -
that O -
if O -
you O -
, O -
with O -
whom O -
she O -
understands O -
the B-PER (45
child I-PER 45)
is O -
placed O -
, O -
will O -
procure O -
authentic O -
proofs O -
of O -
its O -
relationship O -
to O -
her O -

, O -
you O -
may O -
sent O -
it O -
to O -
Paris O -
, O -
where O -
she O -
will O -
properly O -
provide O -
for O -
it O -
. O -

This B-PER (6
woman I-PER 6)
is O -
, O -
undoubtedly O -
, O -
at O -
length O -
, O -
self-convicted O -
of O -
her O -
most O -
unnatural O -
behaviour O -
; O -
it O -
is O -
evident O -
, O -
from O -
her O -
writing O -
, O -
that O -
she O -
is O -
still O -
as O -
vulgar O -
and O -
illiterate O -
as O -
when O -
her B-PER (26|(6)
first I-PER -
husband I-PER 26)
, O -
Mr. B-PER (46
Evelyn O -
, O -
had O -
the O -
weakness O -
to O -
marry O -
her O -
; O -
nor O -
does O -
she O -
at O -
all O -
apologize O -
for O -
addressing O -
herself O -
to O -
me O -
, O -
though O -
I O -
was O -
only O -
once O -
in O -
her O -
company O -
. O -

Her O -
letter O -
has O -
excited O -
in O -
my B-PER (13|(0)
daughter I-PER 13)
Mirvan B-PER (13)
, O -
a O -
strong O -
desire O -
to O -
be O -
informed O -
of O -
the O -
motives O -
which O -
induced O -
Madame B-PER (6
Duval O -
to O -
abandon O -
the O -
unfortunate O -
Lady B-PER -
Belmont O -
, O -
at O -
a O -
time O -
when O -
a B-PER (14
mother I-PER 14)
's O -
protection O -
was O -
peculiarly O -
necessary O -
for O -
her O -
peace O -
and O -
her O -
reputation O -
. O -

Notwithstanding O -
I O -
was O -
personally O -
acquainted O -
with O -
all B-PER (15
the I-PER -
parties I-PER -
concerned I-PER -
in I-PER -
that I-PER -
affair I-PER 15)
, O -
the O -
subject O -
always O -
appeared O -
of O -
too O -
delicate O -
a O -
nature O -
to O -
be O -
spoken O -
of O -
with O -
the B-PER (16
principals I-PER 16)
; O -
I O -
can O -
not O -
, O -
therefore O -
, O -
satisfy O -
Mrs. B-PER (13
Mirvan O -
otherwise O -
than O -
by O -
applying O -
to O -
you O -
. O -

By O -
saying O -
that O -
you O -
may O -
send O -
the B-PER (17
child I-PER 17)
, O -
Madame B-PER (6
Duval O -
aims O -
at O -
conferring O -
, O -
where O -
she O -
most O -
owes O -
obligation O -
. O -

I O -
pretend O -
not O -
to O -
give O -
you O -
advice O -
; O -
you O -
, O -
to O -
whose O -
generous O -
protection O -
this B-PER (17
helpless I-PER -
orphan I-PER 17)
is O -
indebted O -
for O -
every O -
thing O -
, O -
are O -
the B-PER (18
best I-PER -
and I-PER -
only I-PER -
judge I-PER -
of I-PER -
what I-PER -
she I-PER (6)
ought I-PER -
to I-PER -
do I-PER 18)
; O -
but O -
I O -
am O -
much O -
concerned O -
at O -
the O -
trouble O -
and O -
uneasiness O -
which O -
this B-PER (6
unworthy I-PER -
woman I-PER 6)
may O -
occasion O -
you O -

My B-PER (13|(0)

and O -
my B-PER (19|(0)
grandchild I-PER 19)
join O -
with O -
me O -
in O -
desiring O -
to O -
be O -
most O -
kindly O -
remembered O -
to O -
the B-PER (17
amiable I-PER -

; O -
and O -
they O -
bid O -
me O -

you O -

that O -
the O -
annual O -

YOUR B-PER (0|(0)
Ladyship I-PER 0)
did O -
but O -
too O -
well O -
foresee O -
the O -
perplexity O -
and O -
uneasiness O -
of O -
which O -
Madame B-PER (6
Duval O -
's O -
letter O -
has O -
been O -
productive O -
. O -

However O -
, O -
I O -
ought O -
rather O -
to O -
be O -
thankful O -
that O -
I O -
have O -
so O -
many O -
years O -
remained O -
unmolested O -
, O -
than O -
repine O -
at O -
my O -
present O -
embarrassment O -
; O -
since O -
it O -
proves O -
, O -
at O -
least O -
, O -
that O -
this B-PER (6
wretched I-PER -
woman I-PER 6)
is O -
at O -
length O -
awakened O -
to O -
remorse O -
. O -

In O -
regard O -
to O -
my O -
answer O -
, O -
I O -
must O -
humbly O -
request O -
your B-PER (0|(0)

to O -
write O -
to O -
this O -
effect O -
: O -
" O -
That O -
I O -
would O -
not O -
, O -
upon O -
any O -
account O -
, O -
intentionally O -
offend O -
Madame B-PER (6
Duval O -
; O -
but O -
that O -
I O -
have O -
weighty O -
, O -
nay O -
unanswerable O -
reasons O -
for O -
detaining O -
her B-PER (17|(6)
grand-daughter I-PER 17)
at O -
present O -
in O -
England O -
; O -
the O -
principal O -
of O -
which O -
is O -
, O -
that O -
it O -
was O -
the O -
earnest O -
desire O -
of O -
one O -
to O -
whose O -
will O -
she O -
owes O -
implicit O -
duty O -
. O -

Madame B-PER (6
Duval O -
may O -
be O -
assured O -
, O -
that O -
she O -
meets O -
with O -
the O -
utmost O -
attention O -
and O -
tenderness O -
; O -
that O -
her O -
education O -
, O -
however O -
short O -
of O -
my O -
wishes O -
, O -
almost O -
exceeds O -
my O -
abilities O -
; O -
and O -
I O -
flatter O -
myself O -
, O -
when O -
the O -
time O -
arrives O -
that O -
she O -
shall O -
pay O -
her O -
duty O -
to O -
her B-PER (6|(17)
grand-mother I-PER 6)
, O -
Madame B-PER (6
Duval O -
will O -
find O -
no O -
reason O -
to O -
be O -
dissatisfied O -
with O -
what O -
has O -
been O -
done O -
for O -
her O -
. O -
" O -

Your B-PER (0|(0)
Ladyship I-PER 0)
will O -
not O -
, O -
I O -
am O -
sure O -
, O -
be O -
surprised O -
at O -
this O -
answer O -
. O -

Madame B-PER (6
Duval O -
is O -
by O -
no O -
means O -
a O -
proper O -
companion O -
or O -
guardian O -
for O -
a B-PER (25
young I-PER -
woman I-PER 25)|24)
: O -
she O -
is O -
at O -
once O -
uneducated O -
and O -
unprincipled O -
; O -
ungentle O -
in O -
temper O -
, O -
and O -
unamiable O -
in O -
her O -
manners O -
. O -

I O -
have O -
long O -
known O -
that O -
she O -
has O -
persuaded O -
herself O -
to O -
harbour O -
an O -
aversion O -
for O -
me-Unhappy B-PER -
woman I-PER -
! O -

I O -
can O -
only O -
regard O -
her O -
as O -
an O -
object O -
of O -
pity O -
! O -

I O -
dare O -
not O -
hesitate O -
at O -
a O -
request O -
from O -
Mrs. B-PER (13
Mirvan O -
; O -
yet O -
, O -
in O -
complying O -
with O -
it O -
, O -
I O -
shall O -
, O -
for O -
her O -
own O -
sake O -
, O -
be O -
as O -
concise O -
as O -
I O -
possibly O -
can O -
; O -
since O -
the O -
cruel O -
transactions O -
which O -
preceded O -
the O -
birth O -
of O -
my B-PER (17|(1)
ward I-PER 17)
can O -
afford O -
no O -
entertainment O -
to O -
a O -
mind O -
so O -
humane O -
as O -
her O -
's O -
. O -

Your B-PER (0|(0)

probably O -
have O -
heard O -
, O -
that O -

the O -
honour O -
to O -

Mr. B-PER (26

the O -
capacity O -
of O -
a B-PER (27

His O -
unhappy O -
marriage O -

immediately O -
upon O -
his O -
return O -
to O -

with O -
Madame B-PER (6

his O -
native O -
land O -
, O -
and O -
fix O -
his O -
abode O -
in O -
France O -

Thither O -
he O -
was O -
followed O -
by O -
shame O -

repentance O -

his O -
heart O -
was O -
not O -

a O -

on O -
his B-PER (6|(26)

two O -

CHAPTER O -
I O -
THERE O -
IS O -
NO B-PER (3
ONE I-PER 3)
LEFT O -
When O -
Mary B-PER (2
Lennox I-PER 2)
was O -
sent O -
to O -
Misselthwaite O -
Manor O -
to O -
live O -
with O -
her B-PER (5|(2)
uncle I-PER 5)
everybody B-PER (6)
said O -
she O -
was O -
the B-PER (60
most I-PER -
disagreeable-looking I-PER -
child I-PER -
ever I-PER -
seen I-PER 60)
. O -

It O -
was O -
true O -
, O -
too O -
. O -

She O -
had O -
a O -
little O -
thin O -
face O -
and O -
a O -
little O -
thin O -
body O -
, O -
thin O -
light O -
hair O -
and O -
a O -
sour O -
expression O -
. O -

Her O -
hair O -
was O -
yellow O -
, O -
and O -
her O -
face O -
was O -
yellow O -
because O -
she O -
had O -
been O -
born O -
in O -
India O -
and O -
had O -
always O -
been O -
ill O -
in O -
one O -
way O -
or O -
another O -
. O -

Her B-PER (8|(2)
father I-PER 8)
had O -
held O -
a O -
position O -
under O -
the O -
English O -
Government O -
and O -
had O -
always O -
been O -
busy O -
and O -
ill O -
himself O -
, O -
and O -
her B-PER (10|(2)
mother I-PER 10)
had O -
been O -
a O -
great O -
beauty O -
who O -
cared O -
only O -
to O -
go O -
to O -
parties O -
and O -
amuse O -
herself O -
with O -
gay B-PER (11
people I-PER 11)
. O -

She O -
had O -
not O -
wanted O -
a B-PER (56
little I-PER -
girl I-PER 56)
at O -
all O -
, O -
and O -
when O -
Mary B-PER (2)
was O -
born O -
she O -
handed O -
her O -
over O -
to O -
the O -
care O -
of O -
an O -
Ayah O -
, O -
who O -
was O -
made O -
to O -
understand O -
that O -
if O -
she O -
wished O -
to O -
please O -
the B-PER (10
Mem I-PER -
Sahib I-PER 10)
she O -
must O -
keep O -
the B-PER (2
child I-PER 2)
out O -
of O -
sight O -
as O -
much O -
as O -
possible O -
. O -

So O -
when O -
she O -
was O -
a B-PER (61
sickly I-PER -
, I-PER -
fretful I-PER -
, I-PER -
ugly I-PER -
little I-PER -
baby I-PER 61)
she O -
was O -
kept O -
out O -
of O -
the O -
way O -
, O -
and O -
when O -
she O -
became O -
a B-PER (62
sickly I-PER -
, I-PER -
fretful I-PER -
, I-PER -
toddling I-PER -
thing I-PER 62)
she O -
was O -
kept O -
out O -
of O -
the O -
way O -
also O -
. O -

She O -
never O -
remembered O -
seeing O -
familiarly O -
anything O -
but O -
the O -
dark O -
faces O -
of O -
her B-PER (12|(2)
Ayah I-PER 12)
and O -
the B-PER (13
other I-PER -
native I-PER -
servants I-PER 13)
, O -
and O -
as O -
they O -
always O -
obeyed O -
her O -
and O -
gave O -
her O -
her O -
own O -
way O -
in O -
everything O -
, O -
because O -
the B-PER (10
Mem I-PER -
Sahib I-PER 10)
would O -
be O -
angry O -
if O -
she O -
was O -
disturbed O -
by O -
her O -
crying O -
, O -
by O -
the O -
time O -
she O -
was O -
six O -
years O -
old O -
she O -
was O -
as B-PER (63
tyrannical I-PER -
and I-PER -
selfish I-PER -
a I-PER -
little I-PER -
pig I-PER -
as I-PER -
ever I-PER -
lived I-PER 63)
. O -

The B-PER (14
young I-PER -
English I-PER -
governess I-PER -
who I-PER -
came I-PER -
to I-PER -
teach I-PER -
her I-PER (2)
to I-PER -
read I-PER -
and I-PER -
write I-PER 14)
disliked O -
her O -
so O -
much O -
that O -
she O -
gave O -
up O -
her O -
place O -
in O -
three O -
months O -
, O -
and O -
when O -
other B-PER (15
governesses I-PER 15)
came O -
to O -
try O -
to O -
fill O -
it O -
they O -
always O -
went O -
away O -
in O -
a O -
shorter O -
time O -
than O -
the B-PER (14
first I-PER -
one I-PER 14)
. O -

So O -
if O -
Mary B-PER (2)
had O -
not O -
chosen O -
to O -
really O -
want O -
to O -
know O -
how O -
to O -
read O -
books O -
she O -
would O -
never O -
have O -
learned O -
her O -
letters O -
at O -
all O -
. O -

One O -
frightfully O -
hot O -
morning O -
, O -
when O -
she O -
was O -
about O -
nine O -
years O -
old O -
, O -
she O -
awakened O -
feeling O -
very O -
cross O -
, O -
and O -
she O -
became O -
crosser O -
still O -
when O -
she O -
saw O -
that O -
the B-PER (0
servant I-PER -
who I-PER -
stood I-PER -
by I-PER -
her I-PER (2)
bedside I-PER 0)
was O -
not O -
her B-PER (12|(2)
Ayah I-PER 12)
. O -

" O -
Why O -
did O -
you O -
come O -
? O -
" O -
she O -
said O -
to O -
the B-PER (0
strange I-PER -
woman I-PER 0)
. O -

" O -
I O -
will O -
not O -
let O -
you O -

Send O -
my B-PER (12|(2)
Ayah I-PER 12)
to O -
me O -
. O -
" O -

The B-PER (0
woman I-PER 0)
looked O -
frightened O -
, O -
but O -
she O -
only O -
stammered O -
that O -
the B-PER (12
Ayah I-PER 12)
could O -
not O -
come O -
and O -
when O -
Mary B-PER (2)
threw O -
herself O -
into O -
a O -
passion O -
and O -
beat O -
and O -
kicked O -
her O -
, O -
she O -
looked O -
only O -
more O -
frightened O -
and O -
repeated O -
that O -
it O -
was O -
not O -
possible O -
for O -
the B-PER (12
Ayah I-PER 12)
to O -
come O -
to O -
Missie B-PER (2
Sahib O -
. O -

There O -
was O -
something O -
mysterious O -
in O -
the O -
air O -
that O -
morning O -
. O -

Nothing O -
was O -
done O -
in O -
its O -
regular O -
order O -
and O -
several O -
of O -
the B-PER (13
native I-PER -
servants I-PER 13)|16)
seemed O -
missing O -
, O -
while O -
those O -
whom O -
Mary B-PER (2)
saw O -
slunk O -
or O -
hurried O -
about O -
with O -
ashy O -
and O -
scared O -
faces O -
. O -

But O -
no B-PER (17
one I-PER 17)
would O -
tell O -
her O -
anything O -
and O -
her B-PER (12|(2)
Ayah I-PER 12)
did O -
not O -
come O -
. O -

She O -
was O -
actually O -
left O -
alone O -
as O -
the O -
morning O -
went O -
on O -
, O -
and O -
at O -
last O -
she O -
wandered O -
out O -
into O -
the O -
garden O -
and O -
began O -
to O -
play O -
by O -
herself O -
under O -
a O -
tree O -
near O -
the O -
veranda O -
. O -

She O -
pretended O -
that O -
she O -
was O -
making O -
a O -
flower-bed O -
, O -
and O -
she O -
stuck O -
big O -
scarlet O -
hibiscus O -

into O -
little O -
heaps O -
of O -
earth O -
, O -
all O -
the O -
time O -
growing O -
more O -
and O -
more O -
angry O -
and O -
muttering O -
to O -
herself O -
the O -
things O -
she O -
would O -
say O -
and O -
the O -
names O -
she O -
would O -
call O -

" O -
Pig O -

Pig O -
! O -

Daughter B-PER (20
of I-PER -
Pigs I-PER 20)

" O -
she O -
said O -
, O -
because O -
to O -
call O -
a B-PER (21
native I-PER 21)
a O -
pig O -
is O -
the O -
worst O -
insult O -
of O -
all O -
. O -

She O -
was O -
grinding O -
her O -
teeth O -
and O -
saying O -
this O -
over O -
and O -
over O -
again O -
when O -
she O -
heard O -
her B-PER (10|(2)

out O -
on O -
the O -
veranda O -
with O -
some B-PER (22

She O -
was O -
with O -
a B-PER (22

they O -
stood O -
talking O -
together O -
in O -

Mary O -
knew O -
the O -
fair O -
young O -

who O -
looked O -
like O -
a B-PER (24

She O -
had O -
heard O -
that O -
he O -
was O -
a O -
very O -
young O -

who O -
had O -
just O -

The B-PER (2

stared O -
at O -
him O -
, O -
but O -
she O -
stared O -
most O -
at O -
her B-PER (10|(2)

She O -
always O -
did O -
this O -
when O -
she O -
had O -
a O -
chance O -
to O -
see O -
her O -
, O -
because O -

Her O -

she O -
had O -
a O -
delicate O -

seemed O -
to O -

she O -
had O -
large O -
laughing O -

All O -
her O -

Mary B-PER (2)

At O -
that O -

moment O -
such O -

and O -
Mary B-PER (2)
stood O -

The O -

Mrs. B-PER (10

and O -
she O -

After O -
that O -
, O -
appalling O -
things O -
happened O -
, O -
and O -
the O -
mysteriousness O -
of O -
the O -
morning O -
was O -
explained O -
to O -
Mary B-PER (2)
. O -

The O -
cholera O -
had O -
broken O -
out O -
in O -
its O -
most O -
fatal O -
form O -
and O -
people B-PER (42)
were O -
dying O -
like O -
flies O -
. O -

The B-PER (12
Ayah I-PER 12)
had O -
been O -
taken O -
ill O -
in O -
the O -
night O -
, O -
and O -
it O -
was O -
because O -
she O -
had O -
just O -
died O -
that O -
the B-PER (13
servants I-PER 13)
had O -
wailed O -
in O -
the O -
huts O -
. O -

Before O -
the O -
next O -
day O -
three B-PER (29
other I-PER -
servants I-PER 29)
were O -
dead O -
and O -
others O -
had O -
run O -
away O -
in O -
terror O -
. O -

There O -
was O -
panic O -
on O -
every O -
side O -
, O -
and O -
dying B-PER (30
people I-PER 30)
in O -
all O -
the O -
bungalows O -
. O -

During O -
the O -
confusion O -
and O -
bewilderment O -
of O -
the O -
second O -
day O -
Mary B-PER (2)
hid O -
herself O -
in O -
the O -
nursery O -
and O -
was O -
forgotten O -
by O -
everyone B-PER (33)
. O -

Nobody B-PER (34)
thought O -
of O -
her O -
, O -
nobody B-PER (35)
wanted O -
her O -
, O -
and O -
strange O -
things O -
happened O -
of O -
which O -
she O -
knew O -
nothing O -
. O -

Mary O -
alternately O -
cried O -
and O -
slept O -
through O -
the O -
hours O -
. O -

She O -
only O -
knew O -
that O -
people B-PER (42)
were O -
ill O -
and O -
that O -
she O -
heard O -
mysterious O -
and O -
frightening O -
sounds O -
. O -

Once O -
she O -
crept O -
into O -
the O -
dining-room O -
and O -
found O -
it O -
empty O -
, O -
though O -
a O -
partly O -
finished O -
meal O -
was O -
on O -
the O -
table O -
and O -
chairs O -
and O -
plates O -
looked O -
as O -
if O -
they O -
had O -
been O -
hastily O -
pushed O -
back O -
when O -
the B-PER (37
diners I-PER 37)
rose O -
suddenly O -
for O -
some O -
reason O -
. O -

The B-PER (2
child I-PER 2)
ate O -
some O -
fruit O -
and O -
biscuits O -
, O -
and O -
being O -
thirsty O -
she O -
drank O -
a O -
glass O -
of O -
wine O -
which O -
stood O -
nearly O -
filled O -
. O -

It O -
was O -
sweet O -
, O -
and O -
she O -
did O -
not O -
know O -
how O -
strong O -
it O -
was O -
. O -

Very O -
soon O -
it O -
made O -
her O -
intensely O -
drowsy O -
, O -
and O -
she O -
went O -
back O -
to O -
her O -
nursery O -
and O -
shut O -
herself O -
in O -
again O -
, O -
frightened O -
by O -
cries O -
she O -
heard O -
in O -
the O -
huts O -
and O -
by O -
the O -
hurrying O -
sound O -
of O -
feet O -
. O -

The O -
wine O -
made O -
her O -
so O -
sleepy O -
that O -
she O -
could O -
scarcely O -
keep O -
her O -
eyes O -
open O -
and O -
she O -
lay O -
down O -
on O -
her O -
bed O -
and O -
knew O -
nothing O -
more O -
for O -
a O -
long O -
time O -
. O -

Many O -
things O -
happened O -
during O -
the O -
hours O -
in O -
which O -
she O -
slept O -
so O -
heavily O -
, O -
but O -
she O -
was O -
not O -
disturbed O -
by O -
the O -
wails O -
and O -
the O -
sound O -
of O -
things O -
being O -
carried O -
in O -
and O -
out O -
of O -
the O -
bungalow O -
. O -

When O -
she O -
awakened O -
she O -
lay O -
and O -
stared O -
at O -
the O -
wall O -
. O -

The O -
house O -
was O -
perfectly O -
still O -
. O -

She O -
had O -
never O -
known O -
it O -
to O -
be O -
so O -
silent O -
before O -
. O -

She O -
heard O -
neither O -
voices O -
nor O -
footsteps O -
, O -
and O -
wondered O -
if O -
everybody B-PER (6)
had O -
got O -
well O -
of O -
the O -
cholera O -
and O -
all O -
the O -
trouble O -
was O -
over O -
. O -

She O -
wondered O -
also O -
who O -
would O -
take O -
care O -
of O -
her O -
now O -
her B-PER (12|(2)
Ayah I-PER 12)
was O -
dead O -
. O -

There O -
would O -
be O -
a B-PER (38
new I-PER -
Ayah I-PER 38)
, O -
and O -
perhaps O -
she O -
would O -
know O -
some O -
new O -
stories O -
. O -

Mary B-PER (2)
had O -
been O -
rather O -
tired O -
of O -
the O -
old O -
ones O -
. O -

She O -
did O -
not O -
cry O -
because O -
her B-PER (12|(2)
nurse I-PER 12)
had O -
died O -
. O -

She O -
was O -
not O -
an B-PER (58
affectionate I-PER -
child I-PER 58)
and O -
had O -
never O -
cared O -
much O -
for O -
any B-PER (39
one I-PER 39)
. O -

The O -
noise O -
and O -
hurrying O -
about O -
and O -
wailing O -
over O -
the O -
cholera O -
had O -
frightened O -
her O -
, O -
and O -
she O -
had O -
been O -
angry O -
because O -
no B-PER (40
one I-PER 40)
seemed O -
to O -
remember O -
that O -
she O -
was O -
alive O -
. O -

Everyone B-PER (6)
was O -
too O -
panic-stricken O -
to O -
think O -
of O -
a O -
little O -
girl O -
no B-PER (41
one I-PER 41)
was O -
fond O -
of O -
. O -

When O -
people B-PER (42)
had O -
the O -
cholera O -
it O -
seemed O -
that O -
they O -
remembered O -
nothing O -
but O -
themselves O -
. O -

But O -
if O -
everyone B-PER (6)
had O -
got O -
well O -
again O -
, O -
surely O -
some O -
one O -
would O -
remember O -
and O -
come O -
to O -
look O -
for O -
her O -
. O -

But O -
no B-PER (43
one I-PER 43)
came O -
, O -
and O -
as O -
she O -
lay O -
waiting O -
the O -
house O -
seemed O -
to O -
grow O -
more O -
and O -
more O -
silent O -
. O -

She O -
heard O -
something O -
rustling O -
on O -
the O -
matting O -
and O -
when O -
she O -
looked O -
down O -
she O -
saw O -
a O -
little O -
snake O -
gliding O -
along O -
and O -
watching O -
her O -
with O -
eyes O -
like O -
jewels O -
. O -

She O -
was O -
not O -
frightened O -
, O -
because O -
he O -
was O -
a O -
harmless O -
little O -
thing O -
who O -
would O -
not O -
hurt O -
her O -
and O -
he O -
seemed O -
in O -
a O -
hurry O -
to O -
get O -
out O -
of O -
the O -
room O -
. O -

He O -
slipped O -
under O -
the O -
door O -
as O -
she O -
watched O -
him O -
. O -

" O -
How O -
queer O -
and O -
quiet O -
it O -
is O -
, O -
" O -
she O -
said O -
. O -

" O -
It O -
sounds O -
as O -
if O -
there O -
were O -
no B-PER (44
one I-PER 44)
in O -
the O -
bungalow O -
but O -
me O -
and O -
the O -
snake O -
. O -
" O -

Almost O -
the O -
next O -
minute O -
she O -
heard O -
footsteps O -
in O -
the O -
compound O -
, O -
and O -
then O -
on O -
the O -
veranda O -
. O -

They O -
were O -
men B-PER (46)
's O -
footsteps O -
, O -
and O -
the B-PER (46
men I-PER 46)
entered O -
the O -
bungalow O -
and O -
talked O -
in O -
low O -
voices O -
. O -

No B-PER (47
one I-PER 47)
went O -
to O -
meet O -
or O -
speak O -
to O -
them O -
and O -
they O -
seemed O -
to O -
open O -
doors O -
and O -
look O -
into O -
rooms O -

" O -
What O -
desolation O -
! O -

when O -
they O -
opened O -
the O -
door O -
a O -
few O -
minutes O -
later O -
. O -

She O -
looked O -
an B-PER (67
ugly I-PER -

cross I-PER -
little I-PER -
thing I-PER 67)
and O -
was O -
frowning O -
because O -
she O -
was O -
beginning O -
to O -
be O -
hungry O -
and O -
feel O -
disgracefully O -
neglected O -

The B-PER (52

once O -

talking O -
to O -
her B-PER (8|(2)

He O -
looked O -
tired O -

troubled O -

when O -
he O -
saw O -
her O -
he O -
was O -
so O -
startled O -

jumped O -
back O -

if O -

were O -

under O -
the O -

of O -

they O -
wrangled O -

Some O -
of O -
their B-PER (21|(3)

interchanged O -
glances O -
, O -
and O -
one B-PER (22

Miss B-PER (2
Bartlett O -
was O -
startled O -
. O -

Generally O -
at O -
a O -
pension O -
people B-PER (24)
looked O -
them O -
over O -
for O -
a O -
day O -
or O -
two O -
before O -
speaking O -
, O -
and O -
often O -
did O -
not O -
find O -
out O -
that O -
they O -
would O -
“ O -
do O -
” O -
till O -
they O -
had O -
gone O -
. O -

She O -
knew O -
that O -
the B-PER (22
intruder I-PER 22)
was O -
ill-bred O -
, O -
even O -
before O -
she O -
glanced O -
at O -
him O -
. O -

He O -
was O -
an B-PER (62
old I-PER -
man I-PER -
, I-PER -
of I-PER -
heavy I-PER -
build I-PER -
, I-PER -
with I-PER -
a I-PER -

and I-PER -
large I-PER -

. O -

There O -
was O -
something O -
childish O -
in O -
those O -
eyes O -
, O -
though O -
it O -
was O -
not O -
the O -
childishness O -
of O -
senility O -
. O -

What O -
exactly O -
it O -
was O -
Miss B-PER (2

did O -
not O -
stop O -
to O -
consider O -
, O -
for O -
her O -
glance O -
passed O -
on O -
to O -
his O -
clothes O -
. O -

These O -
did O -
not O -
attract O -
her O -
. O -

He O -
was O -
probably O -
trying O -
to O -
become O -
acquainted O -
with O -
them O -
before O -
they O -
got O -
into O -
the O -
swim O -
. O -

So O -
she O -
assumed O -
a O -
dazed O -
expression O -
when O -
he O -
spoke O -
to O -
her O -
, O -
and O -
then O -
said O -
: O -
“ O -
A O -

How O -
delightful O -
a O -

” O -

“ O -
This O -

said O -
the B-PER (22

; O -
“ O -
his O -

He O -
has O -
a O -

” O -

“ O -
Ah O -
, O -
” O -
said O -
Miss B-PER (2

, O -
repressing O -
Lucy B-PER (7)
, O -
who O -
was O -
about O -
to O -
speak O -
. O -

“ O -
What O -
I O -
mean O -
, O -
” O -
he O -
continued O -
, O -
“ O -
is O -
that O -
you O -

have O -

” O -

The O -
better O -
class O -
of O -
tourist B-PER (29)|28)
was O -
shocked O -
at O -
this O -
, O -
and O -
sympathized O -
with O -
the B-PER (3
new-comers I-PER 3)
. O -

Miss B-PER (2
Bartlett O -
, O -
in O -
reply O -
, O -
opened O -
her O -
mouth O -
as O -
little O -
as O -
possible O -
, O -
and O -
said O -
“ O -
Thank O -
you O -
very O -
much O -
indeed O -
; O -
that O -
is O -
out O -
of O -
the O -

” O -

“ O -
Why O -
? O -
” O -

said O -
the B-PER (22
old I-PER -
man I-PER 22)
, O -
with O -
both O -
fists O -
on O -
the O -
table O -
. O -

“ O -
Because O -
it O -
is O -
quite O -
out O -
of O -

“ O -
You O -
see O -
, O -
we O -
do O -

like O -
to O -

” O -
began O -
Lucy B-PER (7)
. O -

Her B-PER (2|(7)
cousin I-PER 2)
again O -
repressed O -
her O -
. O -

“ O -
But O -
why O -
? O -
” O -

he O -
persisted O -
. O -

“ O -
Women B-PER (30)
like O -
looking O -
at O -
a O -
view O -
; O -
men B-PER (31)
do O -
n’t O -
. O -
” O -

And O -
he O -
thumped O -
with O -
his O -
fists O -
like O -
a B-PER (22
naughty I-PER -
child I-PER 22)
, O -
and O -
turned O -
to O -
his B-PER (25|(22)
son I-PER 25)
, O -
saying O -
, O -
“ O -
George B-PER (25)
, O -
persuade O -
them O -
! O -
” O -

“ O -
It O -
’s O -
so O -
obvious O -
they O -
should O -
have O -
the O -

said O -
the B-PER (25
son I-PER 25)
. O -

“ O -
There O -
’s O -
nothing O -
else O -
to O -
say O -

” O -

He O -
did O -
not O -
look O -
at O -
the B-PER (3
ladies I-PER 3)
as O -
he O -
spoke O -
, O -
but O -
his O -
voice O -
was O -
perplexed O -
and O -
sorrowful O -
. O -

Lucy B-PER (7)
, O -
too O -
, O -
was O -
perplexed O -
; O -
but O -
she O -
saw O -
that O -
they O -
were O -
in O -
for O -
what O -
is O -
known O -
as O -
“ O -
quite O -
a O -
scene O -
, O -
” O -
and O -
she O -
had O -
an O -
odd O -
feeling O -
that O -
whenever O -
these B-PER (27
ill-bred I-PER -
tourists I-PER 27)
spoke O -
the O -
contest O -
widened O -
and O -
deepened O -
till O -
it O -
dealt O -
, O -
not O -
with O -
rooms O -
and O -
views O -
, O -
but O -
with O -
-- O -
well O -
, O -
with O -
something O -
quite O -
different O -
, O -
whose O -
existence O -
she O -
had O -
not O -
realized O -
before O -
. O -

Now O -
the B-PER (22
old I-PER -
man I-PER 22)
attacked O -
Miss B-PER (2
Bartlett O -
almost O -
violently O -
: O -
Why O -
should O -
she O -
not O -
change O -
? O -

What O -
possible O -
objection O -
had O -
she O -
? O -

They O -
would O -
clear O -
out O -
in O -
half O -
an O -
hour O -
. O -

Miss B-PER (2
Bartlett O -
, O -
though O -
skilled O -
in O -
the O -
delicacies O -
of O -
conversation O -
, O -
was O -
powerless O -
in O -
the O -
presence O -
of O -
brutality O -
. O -

It O -
was O -
impossible O -
to O -
snub O -
any B-PER (22
one I-PER -
so I-PER -
gross I-PER 22)
. O -

Her O -
face O -
reddened O -
with O -
displeasure O -
. O -

She O -
looked O -
around O -
as O -
much O -
as O -
to O -
say O -
, O -
“ O -
Are O -
you O -
all O -
like O -
this O -
? O -
” O -

And O -
two B-PER (33
little I-PER -
old I-PER -

, I-PER -
who I-PER -
were I-PER -
sitting I-PER -
further I-PER -
up I-PER -

, O -
with O -
shawls O -
hanging O -
over O -
the O -
backs O -
of O -
the O -
chairs O -
, O -
looked O -
back O -
, O -
clearly O -
indicating O -
“ O -
We O -

not O -

we O -
are O -
genteel O -

” O -

“ O -
Eat O -
your O -
dinner O -
, O -

” O -
she O -
said O -
to O -
Lucy B-PER (7)
, O -
and O -
began O -
to O -
toy O -
again O -
with O -
the O -
meat O -
that O -
she O -
had O -
once O -
censured O -
. O -

Lucy B-PER (7)
mumbled O -
that O -
those O -
seemed O -
very B-PER (27
odd I-PER -
people I-PER -
opposite I-PER 27)

“ O -
Eat O -

a O -

Hardly O -
had O -
she O -
announced O -
this O -
fell O -
decision O -
when O -
she O -
reversed O -
it O -
. O -

The O -
curtains O -
at O -
the O -
end O -
of O -
the O -
room O -
parted O -
, O -
and O -
revealed O -
a B-PER (36

stout I-PER -

attractive I-PER -
, I-PER -
who I-PER -
hurried I-PER -
forward I-PER -

his I-PER (36)

at I-PER -
the I-PER -

Lucy B-PER (7)
, O -
who O -
had O -
not O -

acquired O -

at O -
once O -
rose O -

Miss B-PER (2

with O -
more O -
restraint O -
: O -
“ O -

But O -
he O -

forward O -
pleasantly O -
enough O -

accepted O -

he O -
was O -
beckoned O -

“ O -

rather O -

to O -
Miss B-PER (2

who O -
probably O -
remembered O -
his O -

He O -
asked O -
the B-PER (7

whether O -
she O -
knew O -

was O -
informed O -

some O -

“ O -

indeed O -
, O -
a O -

torrent O -
of O -

burst O -
on O -
them O -

People B-PER (56)
told O -

I O -
must O -
admit O -
that O -
his O -

gave O -
me O -
keen O -
pleasure O -

for O -
I O -
had O -
often O -

piqued O -

I O -

was O -
proud O -

the O -

with O -

him O -
a O -

“ O -
It O -

“ O -
Now O -
, O -
you O -
will O -
observe O -
that O -

They O -
went O -
quickly O -

so O -
silently O -
that O -

with O -

There O -
were O -

At O -
the O -
rear O -

of O -
the O -
car O -
there O -
was O -
no O -
platform O -

but O -
a O -
step O -
where O -
passengers B-PER (112)
clung O -
in O -
wet O -
clumps O -
when O -
the O -
weather O -
was O -
bad O -
and O -
the O -

crowded O -
. O -

The B-PER (112
patrons I-PER 112)
-- O -
if O -
not O -
too O -
absent-minded O -
-- O -
put O -
their O -
fares O -
into O -
a O -
slot O -
; O -
and O -
no B-PER (114
conductor I-PER 114)
paced O -
the O -
heaving O -

, O -
but O -
the B-PER (115

would O -
rap O -
remindingly O -
with O -
his O -
elbow O -
upon O -
the O -
glass O -
of O -
the O -
door O -
to O -
his O -
little O -

if O -
the O -
nickels O -
and O -
the B-PER (112

did O -
not O -
appear O -
to O -
coincide O -
in O -
number O -
. O -

A O -
lone O -
mule O -
drew O -
the O -
car O -
, O -
and O -
sometimes O -
drew O -
it O -
off O -
the O -
track O -
, O -
when O -
the B-PER (112

would O -
get O -
out O -
and O -
push O -
it O -
on O -
again O -

They O -
really O -
owed O -
it O -
courtesies O -

this O -
, O -
for O -
the O -
car O -
was O -
genially O -
accommodating O -
: O -
a B-PER (116

could O -
whistle O -
to O -
it O -
from O -
an O -
upstairs O -
window O -
, O -
and O -
the O -

would O -
halt O -
at O -

wait O -

she O -
shut O -
the O -
window O -
, O -
put O -

her O -

went O -
downstairs O -
, O -
found O -
an O -

told O -
the B-PER (89

what O -
to O -
have O -
for O -
dinner O -
, O -
and O -
came O -
forth O -
from O -
the O -
house O -
. O -

The B-PER (120
previous I-PER -

made O -
little O -
objection O -
to O -
such O -
gallantry O -
on O -
the O -
part O -
of O -
the O -

: O -
they O -
were O -

too O -

a O -

How O -
could O -

in O -
London O -
? O -

and O -
even O -
if O -

that O -

give O -
up O -

a B-PER (29

but O -
he O -
's O -
brave O -

and O -
gets O -
quite O -
cross O -
when O -
we O -
inquire O -
after O -
it O -

Men O -
like O -
the B-PER (34

would O -
do O -
Tibby B-PER (29)
a O -
power O -
of O -
good O -
. O -

But O -
you O -
wo O -
n't O -
agree O -
, O -
and O -
I O -
'd O -
better O -
change O -
the O -
subject O -
. O -

This O -
long O -
letter O -
is O -
because O -
I O -
'm O -
writing O -
before O -
breakfast O -
. O -

Oh O -
, O -
the O -
beautiful O -
vine O -

The O -
house O -
is O -
covered O -
with O -

I O -
looked O -
out O -
earlier O -
, O -
and O -
Mrs. B-PER (21
Wilcox O -
was O -
already O -
in O -
the O -
garden O -
. O -

She O -
evidently O -
loves O -
it O -
. O -

No O -
wonder O -
she O -
sometimes O -
looks O -
tired O -
. O -

She O -
was O -
watching O -
the O -
large O -
red O -
poppies O -
come O -
out O -
. O -

Then O -
she O -
walked O -
off O -
the O -
lawn O -
to O -
the O -
meadow O -
, O -
whose O -
corner O -
to O -
the O -
right O -
I O -
can O -
just O -
see O -
. O -

Trail O -
, O -
trail O -
, O -
went O -
her O -
long O -
dress O -
over O -
the O -
sopping O -
grass O -
, O -
and O -
she O -
came O -
back O -
with O -
her O -
hands O -
full O -
of O -
the O -
hay O -
that O -
was O -
cut O -
yesterday O -
-- O -
I O -
suppose O -
for O -
rabbits O -
or O -
something O -
, O -
as O -
she O -
kept O -
on O -
smelling O -
it O -
. O -

The O -
air O -
here O -
is O -
delicious O -
. O -

Later O -
on O -
I O -
heard O -
the O -
noise O -
of O -
croquet O -
balls O -
, O -
and O -
looked O -
out O -
again O -
, O -
and O -
it O -
was O -
Charles B-PER (31
Wilcox I-PER 31)
practising O -
; O -
they O -
are O -
keen O -
on O -
all O -
games O -
. O -

Presently O -
he O -
started O -
sneezing O -
and O -
had O -
to O -
stop O -
. O -

Then O -
I O -
hear O -
more O -
clicketing O -
, O -
and O -
it O -
is O -
Mr. B-PER (20
Wilcox O -
practising O -
, O -
and O -
then O -
, O -
' O -
a-tissue O -
, O -
a-tissue O -
' O -
: O -
he O -
has O -
to O -
stop O -
too O -
. O -

Then O -
Evie B-PER (37)
comes O -
out O -
, O -
and O -
does O -
some O -
calisthenic O -
exercises O -
on O -
a O -
machine O -
that O -
is O -
tacked O -
on O -
to O -
a O -
greengage-tree O -
-- O -
they O -
put O -
everything O -
to O -
use O -
-- O -
and O -
then O -
she O -
says O -
' O -
a-tissue O -
, O -
' O -
and O -
in O -
she O -
goes O -
. O -

And O -
finally O -
Mrs. B-PER (21

reappears O -
, O -
trail O -
, O -
trail O -
, O -
still O -
smelling O -
hay O -
and O -
looking O -
at O -
the O -
flowers O -
. O -

I O -
inflict O -
all O -
this O -
on O -
you O -
because O -
once O -
you O -
said O -
that O -
life O -
is O -
sometimes O -
life O -
and O -
sometimes O -
only O -
a O -
drama O -
, O -
and O -
one O -
must O -
learn O -
to O -
distinguish O -
t O -
' O -
other O -
from O -
which O -
, O -
and O -
up O -
to O -
now O -
I O -
have O -
always O -
put O -
that O -
down O -
as O -
' O -
Meg B-PER (1)
's O -
clever O -
nonsense O -
. O -
' O -

But O -
this O -
morning O -
, O -
it O -
really O -
does O -
seem O -
not O -
life O -
but O -
a O -
play O -
, O -
and O -
it O -
did O -
amuse O -
me O -
enormously O -
to O -
watch O -
the B-PER (34
W I-PER -

. O -

Now O -
Mrs. B-PER (21

has O -
come O -
in O -
. O -

I O -
am O -
going O -
to O -
wear O -
[ O -

Last O -

wore O -
an O -
[ O -
omission O -

, O -
and O -
Evie B-PER (37)
[ O -
omission O -
] O -
. O -

So O -
it O -
is O -
n't O -
exactly O -
a O -
go-as-you-please O -
place O -
, O -
and O -
if O -
you O -
shut O -
your O -
eyes O -
it O -
still O -
seems O -
the O -
wiggly O -
hotel O -
that O -
we O -
expected O -
. O -

Not O -
if O -
you O -
open O -
them O -
. O -

The O -
dog-roses O -
are O -
too O -
sweet O -
. O -

There O -
is O -
a O -
great O -
hedge O -
of O -
them O -
over O -
the O -
lawn O -
-- O -
magnificently O -
tall O -

so O -
that O -
they O -
fall O -
down O -
in O -
garlands O -
, O -
and O -
nice O -
and O -
thin O -
at O -
the O -
bottom O -
, O -
so O -
that O -
you O -
can O -
see O -
ducks O -
through O -
it O -
and O -
a O -
cow O -
. O -

These O -
belong O -
to O -
the O -

anything O -

the O -
best O -
of O -
it O -
is O -
that O -

do O -
not O -

folded O -

gave O -

I O -
never O -

myself O -
in O -

I O -
could O -
n't O -
point O -
to O -
a O -
time O -
when O -

had O -
been O -

even O -
to O -
a O -
time O -
when O -
the O -
wish O -

had O -
made O -

happier O -
in O -

I O -
could O -

say O -
a O -

I O -
had O -
just O -
picked O -
up O -
the O -

good O -
from O -
some O -
book O -

from O -

Tibby B-PER (29)

She O -
broke O -
off O -

of O -

the O -

into O -

Though O -
the O -

As O -
the O -

the O -

began O -
to O -
tremble O -
with O -
eagerness O -
at O -
the O -
noise O -
of O -

It O -
cast O -
its O -

at O -

when O -

Once O -

went O -
resolutely O -
to O -

He O -
came O -
flying O -
back O -

He O -
was O -

To O -
his B-PER (19|(11)

he O -
drew O -
a O -

When O -
he O -

the B-PER (19

another B-PER (24

loudly O -

His O -

his O -

The B-PER (11

felt O -
called O -
upon O -
to O -
defend O -
the O -
truth O -
of O -
a O -
rumor O -

himself O -

He O -
and O -
the O -

came O -
near O -
to O -
fighting O -
over O -
it O -

A B-PER (25
corporal I-PER 25)
began O -
to O -
swear O -
before O -
the B-PER (19
assemblage I-PER 19)

He O -
had O -
just O -
put O -
a O -
costly O -
board O -

in O -
his O -

he O -
said O -

During O -
the O -
early O -

he O -
had O -
refrained O -
from O -
adding O -
extensively O -
to O -
the O -
comfort O -
of O -
his O -

because O -
he O -

start O -

at O -
any O -
moment O -

Of O -
late O -

he O -
had O -
been O -
impressed O -
that O -

were O -
in O -
a O -
sort O -
of O -
eternal O -
camp O -
. O -

Many B-PER (29
of I-PER -
the I-PER -
men I-PER 29)
engaged O -
in O -
a O -
spirited O -
debate O -
. O -

One O -
outlined O -
in O -
a O -
peculiarly O -
lucid O -
manner O -
all O -
the O -
plans O -
of O -
the B-PER (31
commanding I-PER -
general I-PER 31)

He O -
was O -
opposed O -
by O -
men B-PER (32

advocated I-PER -
that I-PER -
there I-PER -

They O -
clamored O -
at O -
each O -

numbers O -
making O -

Meanwhile O -
, O -
the B-PER (11

fetched I-PER -
the I-PER -

bustled O -
about O -

grew O -
much O -

over O -

There O -
was O -
a B-PER (34

listened O -
with O -
eager O -
ears O -
to O -
the O -
words O -
of O -
the B-PER (11

to O -
the O -
varied O -
comments O -
of O -
his B-PER (35|(34)

After O -
receiving O -
a O -
fill O -
of O -
discussions O -
concerning O -
marches O -

, O -
he O -
went O -
to O -
his O -
hut O -

crawled O -
through O -
an O -
intricate O -
hole O -
that O -
served O -
it O -
as O -
a O -
door O -

He O -
wished O -

alone O -
with O -
some O -

had O -
lately O -

lay O -
down O -

The B-PER (34

was O -
in O -
a O -
little O -
trance O -
of O -
astonishment O -

they O -
were O -
at O -
last O -
going O -

On O -
the O -

perhaps O -
, O -
there O -
would O -
be O -
a O -
battle O -

and O -
he O -
would O -
be O -
in O -
it O -
. O -

For O -
a O -
time O -
he O -
was O -
obliged O -
to O -
labor O -
to O -
make O -
himself O -
believe O -

He O -
could O -
not O -
accept O -
with O -
assurance O -
an O -
omen O -
that O -
he O -
was O -
about O -
to O -
mingle O -
in O -
one O -
of O -
those O -
great O -
affairs O -
of O -
the O -

He O -
had O -
, O -
of O -
course O -

dreamed O -
of O -
battles O -
all O -
his O -
life O -

of O -
vague O -

bloody O -

that O -
had O -
thrilled O -
him O -
with O -
their O -
sweep O -

fire O -
. O -

In O -
visions O -
he O -
had O -
seen O -
himself O -
in O -
many O -
struggles O -

He O -
had O -
imagined O -
peoples B-PER (40

shadow I-PER -
of I-PER -
his I-PER (34)
eagle-eyed I-PER -

. O -

But O -
awake O -
he O -
had O -
regarded O -
battles O -
as O -
crimson O -
blotches O -
on O -
the O -
pages O -
of O -
the O -
past O -
. O -

He O -
had O -
put O -
them O -
as O -
things O -
of O -
the O -
bygone O -
with O -
his O -
thought-images O -
of O -
heavy O -

There O -
was O -
a O -
portion O -

which O -
he O -
had O -
regarded O -
as O -
the O -

it O -
, O -
he O -
thought O -

had O -
been O -
long O -
gone O -
over O -

horizon O -
and O -
had O -
disappeared O -
forever O -
. O -

From O -
his O -
home O -
his O -

looked O -
upon O -
the O -

with O -
distrust O -
. O -

It O -
must O -
be O -
some O -

of O -

He O -
had O -
long O -
despaired O -
of O -
witnessing O -
a O -
Greeklike O -

Such O -
would O -
be O -
no O -

But O -
his B-PER (46|(34)
mother I-PER 46)
had O -
discouraged O -
him O -
. O -

She O -
had O -
affected O -
to O -
look O -
with O -
some O -
contempt O -
upon O -
the O -
quality O -
of O -
his O -
war O -
ardor O -
and O -
patriotism O -
. O -

She O -
could O -
calmly O -
seat O -
herself O -
and O -
with O -
no O -
apparent O -
difficulty O -
give O -
him O -
many O -
hundreds O -
of O -
reasons O -
why O -
he O -
was O -
of O -
vastly O -
more O -
importance O -
on O -
the O -
farm O -
than O -
on O -
the O -
field O -
of O -
battle O -
. O -

She O -
had O -
had O -
certain O -
ways O -
of O -
expression O -
that O -
told O -
him O -
that O -
her O -
statements O -
on O -
the O -
subject O -
came O -
from O -
a O -
deep O -
conviction O -
. O -

Moreover O -
, O -
on O -
her O -
side O -
, O -
was O -
his O -
belief O -
that O -
her O -
ethical O -
motive O -
in O -
the O -
argument O -
was O -
impregnable O -
. O -

At O -
last O -
, O -
however O -
, O -
he O -
had O -
made O -
firm O -
rebellion O -
against O -
this O -
yellow O -
light O -
thrown O -
upon O -
the O -
color O -
of O -
his O -
ambitions O -
. O -

The O -
newspapers O -
, O -
the O -
gossip O -
of O -
the O -
village O -
, O -
his O -
own O -
picturings O -
, O -
had O -
aroused O -
him O -
to O -
an O -
uncheckable O -
degree O -
. O -

They O -
were O -
in O -
truth O -
fighting O -
finely O -
down O -
there O -
. O -

Almost O -
every O -
day O -
the O -
newspaper O -
printed O -
accounts O -
of O -
a O -
decisive O -
victory O -
. O -

One O -
night O -
, O -
as O -
he O -
lay O -
in O -
bed O -
, O -
the O -
winds O -
had O -
carried O -
to O -
him O -
the O -
clangoring O -
of O -
the O -
church O -
bell O -
as O -
some B-PER (51
enthusiast I-PER 51)
jerked O -
the O -
rope O -
frantically O -
to O -
tell O -
the O -
twisted O -
news O -
of O -
a O -
great O -
battle O -
. O -

This O -
voice O -
of O -
the B-PER (52
people I-PER -
rejoicing I-PER -
in I-PER -
the I-PER -
night I-PER 52)
had O -
made O -
him O -
shiver O -
in O -
a O -
prolonged O -
ecstasy O -
of O -
excitement O -
. O -

Later O -
, O -
he O -
had O -
gone O -
down O -
to O -
his B-PER (46|(53|(34)
mother I-PER 46)
's O -
room O -
and O -
had O -
spoken O -
thus O -
: O -
" O -

" O -

" O -
Henry B-PER (34)

n't O -
you O -
be O -
a O -
fool O -
, O -
" O -
his B-PER (46|(34)
mother I-PER 46)
had O -
replied O -
. O -

She O -
had O -
then O -
covered O -
her O -
face O -
with O -
the O -
quilt O -
. O -

There O -
was O -
an O -
end O -
to O -
the O -
matter O -
for O -
that O -
night O -
. O -

Nevertheless O -
, O -
the O -
next O -
morning O -
he O -
had O -
gone O -
to O -
a O -
town O -
that O -
was O -
near O -
his B-PER (46|(47|(34)
mother I-PER 46)
's O -
farm O -
and O -
had O -
enlisted O -
in O -
a O -
company O -
that O -
was O -
forming O -
there O -
. O -

When O -
he O -
had O -
returned O -
home O -
his B-PER (46|(34)
mother I-PER 46)
was O -
milking O -
the O -
brindle O -
cow O -
. O -

Four O -
others O -
stood O -
waiting O -
. O -

" O -
Ma O -
, O -
I O -
've O -
enlisted O -
, O -
" O -
he O -
had O -
said O -
to O -
her O -
diffidently O -
. O -

There O -
was O -
a O -
short O -
silence O -
. O -

" O -
The O -
Lord O -

, O -
Henry B-PER (34)
, O -
" O -
she O -
had O -
finally O -
replied O -
, O -
and O -
had O -
then O -
continued O -
to O -
milk O -
the O -
brindle O -
cow O -
. O -

When O -
he O -
had O -
stood O -
in O -
the O -
doorway O -
with O -
his B-PER (34)
soldier I-PER -
's O -
clothes O -
on O -
his O -
back O -
, O -
and O -
with O -
the O -
light O -
of O -
excitement O -
and O -
expectancy O -
in O -
his O -
eyes O -
almost O -
defeating O -
the O -
glow O -
of O -
regret O -
for O -
the O -
home O -
bonds O -
, O -
he O -
had O -
seen O -
two O -
tears O -
leaving O -
their O -
trails O -
on O -
his B-PER (46|(34)
mother I-PER 46)
's O -
scarred O -
cheeks O -
. O -

Still O -
, O -
she O -
had O -
disappointed O -
him O -
by O -
saying O -
nothing O -
whatever O -
about O -
returning O -
with O -
his O -
shield O -
or O -
on O -
it O -
. O -

He O -
had O -
privately O -
primed O -
himself O -
for O -
a O -
beautiful O -
scene O -
. O -

He O -
had O -
prepared O -
certain O -
sentences O -
which O -
he O -
thought O -
could O -
be O -
used O -
with O -
touching O -
effect O -
. O -

But O -
her O -
words O -
destroyed O -
his O -
plans O -

She O -
had O -
doggedly O -
peeled O -
potatoes O -
and O -
addressed O -
him O -
as O -

our B-PER (121|(2)

watched O -

back I-PER -
as O -
he O -
stood O -
in O -

looking O -

looked O -
half O -

We O -
exchanged O -
a O -

other O -
we O -
did O -
not O -

We O -
felt O -
meditative O -

fit O -
for O -
nothing O -

placid O -

the O -
very O -

on O -

the O -

the O -

sank O -

came O -
over O -

the O -
serenity O -
became O -
less O -

more O -
profound O -

outside O -

My O -

Home O -
The O -
first O -
place O -
that O -
I O -
can O -
well O -
remember O -
was O -
a O -
large O -
pleasant O -
meadow O -
with O -
a O -
pond O -
of O -
clear O -
water O -
in O -
it O -
. O -

Some O -
shady O -

leaned O -
over O -
it O -
, O -
and O -
rushes O -
and O -
water-lilies O -
grew O -
at O -
the O -
deep O -
end O -
. O -

Over O -
the O -
hedge O -
on O -
one O -
side O -
we O -
looked O -
into O -
a O -
plowed O -
field O -
, O -
and O -
on O -
the O -
other O -
we O -
looked O -
over O -
a O -
gate O -
at O -
our O -
master O -

house O -
, O -
which O -
stood O -
by O -
the O -
roadside O -
; O -
at O -
the O -
top O -
of O -
the O -
meadow O -
was O -
a O -
grove O -

and O -
at O -
the O -
bottom O -
a O -
running O -
brook O -
overhung O -
by O -
a O -
steep O -

. O -

While O -
I O -
was O -
young O -
I O -
lived O -
upon O -
my B-PER (8|(0)
mother I-PER 8)
’s O -
milk O -
, O -
as O -
I O -
could O -
not O -
eat O -
grass O -

In O -
the O -
daytime O -
I O -
ran O -
by O -
her O -
side O -
, O -
and O -
at O -
night O -
I O -
lay O -
down O -
close O -
by O -
her O -
. O -

When O -
it O -
was O -
hot O -
we O -
used O -
to O -
stand O -
by O -
the O -
pond O -
in O -
the O -
shade O -
of O -
the O -
trees O -
, O -
and O -
when O -
it O -
was O -
cold O -
we O -
had O -
a O -
nice O -
warm O -
shed O -
near O -
the O -
grove O -
. O -

As O -
soon O -
as O -
I O -
was O -
old O -
enough O -
to O -
eat O -
grass O -
my B-PER (8|(0)
mother I-PER 8)
used O -
to O -
go O -
out O -
to O -
work O -
in O -
the O -
daytime O -
, O -
and O -
come O -
back O -
in O -
the O -
evening O -
. O -

There O -
were O -
six B-PER (11

in O -
the O -
meadow O -
besides O -
me O -
; O -
they O -
were O -
older O -
than O -
I O -
was O -
; O -
some O -
were O -
nearly O -
as O -
large O -
as O -
grown-up O -
horses O -
. O -

I O -
used O -
to O -
run O -
with O -
them O -
, O -
and O -
had O -
great O -
fun O -
; O -
we O -
used O -
to O -
gallop O -
all O -
together O -
round O -
and O -
round O -
the O -
field O -
as O -
hard O -
as O -
we O -
could O -
go O -
. O -

Sometimes O -
we O -
had O -
rather O -
rough O -
play O -
, O -
for O -
they O -
would O -
frequently O -
bite O -
and O -
kick O -
as O -
well O -
as O -

One O -
day O -
, O -
when O -

was O -
a O -
good O -
deal O -
of O -

my B-PER (8|(0)

whinnied O -
to O -
me O -
to O -

to O -
her O -

then O -
she O -
said O -

I O -

I O -
knew O -

a B-PER (73

and O -
our B-PER (18|(3)
master I-PER 18)
thought O -
a O -
great O -
deal O -
of O -
her O -
. O -

Her O -
name O -
was O -
Duchess B-PER (8)
, O -
but O -
he O -
often O -
called O -
her O -
Pet B-PER (8)

Our B-PER (18|(3)
master I-PER 18)
was O -
a B-PER (66
good I-PER -
, I-PER -
kind I-PER -
man I-PER 66)

He O -
gave O -
us O -
good O -
food O -

good O -
lodging O -
, O -
and O -
kind O -
words O -
; O -
he O -
spoke O -
as O -
kindly O -
to O -
us O -
as O -
he O -
did O -
to O -
his B-PER (19|(18)
little I-PER -

. O -

We O -
were O -
all O -
fond O -
of O -
him O -
, O -
and O -
my B-PER (8|(0)
mother I-PER 8)
loved O -
him O -
very O -
much O -
. O -

When O -
she O -
saw O -
him O -
at O -
the O -
gate O -
she O -
would O -
neigh O -
with O -
joy O -
, O -
and O -
trot O -
up O -
to O -
him O -

He O -
would O -
pat O -

stroke O -
her O -
and O -
say O -
, O -
“ O -
Well O -
, O -
old B-PER (18

” O -

I O -
was O -
a O -
dull O -
black O -
, O -
so O -
he O -
called O -
me O -
Darkie B-PER (0)
; O -
then O -
he O -
would O -
give O -
me O -
a O -
piece O -
of O -
bread O -
, O -
which O -
was O -
very O -
good O -
, O -
and O -
sometimes O -
he O -
brought O -
a O -
carrot O -
for O -
my B-PER (8|(0)
mother I-PER 8)
. O -

All B-PER (3
the I-PER -
horses I-PER 3)
would O -
come O -
to O -
him O -
, O -
but O -
I O -
think O -
we O -
were O -
his B-PER (74|(18)
favorites I-PER 74)
. O -

My B-PER (8|(0)
mother I-PER 8)
always O -
took O -
him O -
to O -
the O -
town O -
on O -
a O -
market O -
day O -
in O -
a O -
light O -
gig O -
. O -

There O -
was O -
a B-PER (21
plowboy I-PER 21)
, O -
Dick B-PER (75)
, O -
who O -
sometimes O -
came O -
into O -
our O -
field O -
to O -
pluck O -
blackberries O -
from O -
the O -
hedge O -
. O -

When O -
he O -
had O -
eaten O -
all O -
he O -
wanted O -
he O -
would O -
have O -
what O -
he O -
called O -
fun O -
with O -
the B-PER (11
colts I-PER 11)
, O -
throwing O -
stones O -
and O -
sticks O -
at O -
them O -
to O -
make O -
them O -
gallop O -
. O -

We O -
did O -
not O -
much O -
mind O -
him O -
, O -
for O -
we O -
could O -
gallop O -
off O -
; O -
but O -
sometimes O -
a O -
stone O -
would O -
hit O -
and O -
hurt O -
us O -
. O -

One O -
day O -
he O -
was O -
at O -
this O -
game O -
, O -
and O -
did O -
not O -
know O -
that O -
the B-PER (18
master I-PER 18)
was O -
in O -
the O -
next O -
field O -
; O -
but O -
he O -
was O -
there O -
, O -
watching O -
what O -
was O -
going O -
on O -
; O -
over O -
the O -
hedge O -
he O -
jumped O -
in O -
a O -
snap O -
, O -
and O -
catching O -
Dick B-PER (21)
by O -
the O -
arm O -
, O -
he O -
gave O -
him O -
such O -
a O -
box O -
on O -
the O -
ear O -
as O -
made O -
him O -
roar O -
with O -
the O -
pain O -
and O -
surprise O -
. O -

As O -
soon O -
as O -
we O -
saw O -
the B-PER (18
master I-PER 18)
we O -
trotted O -
up O -
nearer O -
to O -
see O -
what O -
went O -
on O -
. O -

“ O -
Bad B-PER (21
boy I-PER 21)
! O -
” O -
he O -
said O -
, O -
“ O -
bad B-PER (21
boy I-PER 21)
! O -

to O -
chase O -
the B-PER (11
colts I-PER 11)
. O -

This O -
is O -
not O -
the O -
first O -
time O -
, O -
nor O -
the O -
second O -
, O -
but O -
it O -
shall O -
be O -
the O -

There O -
-- O -
take O -
your O -
money O -
and O -
go O -

I O -
shall O -
not O -
want O -
you O -

my O -

again O -

” O -

So O -
we O -
never O -
saw O -
Dick B-PER (21)
any O -
more O -
. O -

Old B-PER (25
Daniel I-PER 25)
, O -
the O -
man O -
who O -
looked O -
after O -
the B-PER (3
horses I-PER 67)|3)
, O -
was O -
just O -
as O -
gentle O -
as O -
our B-PER (18|(3)
master I-PER 18)
, O -
so O -
we O -
were O -
well O -
off O -

02 O -
The O -
Hunt O -
Before O -
I O -
was O -
two O -
years O -
old O -
a O -
circumstance O -
happened O -
which O -
I O -
have O -
never O -
forgotten O -
. O -

It O -
was O -
early O -
in O -
the O -
spring O -
; O -
there O -
had O -
been O -
a O -
little O -
frost O -
in O -
the O -
night O -
, O -
and O -
a O -
light O -
mist O -
still O -
hung O -
over O -
the O -
woods O -
and O -
meadows O -
. O -

I O -
and O -
the B-PER (11
other I-PER -
colts I-PER 11)
were O -
feeding O -
at O -
the O -
lower O -
part O -
of O -
the O -
field O -
when O -
we O -
heard O -
, O -
quite O -
in O -
the O -
distance O -
, O -
what O -
sounded O -
like O -
the O -
cry O -
of O -
dogs O -
. O -

The O -
oldest O -
of O -
the B-PER (11
colts I-PER 11)|28)
raised O -
his O -
head O -
, O -
pricked O -
his O -
ears O -
, O -
and O -
said O -
, O -
“ O -
There O -
are O -
the O -
hounds O -
! O -
” O -
and O -
immediately O -
cantered O -
off O -
, O -
followed O -
by O -
the O -
rest O -
of O -
us O -
to O -
the O -
upper O -
part O -
of O -
the O -
field O -
, O -
where O -
we O -
could O -
look O -
over O -
the O -
hedge O -
and O -
see O -
several O -
fields O -
beyond O -
. O -

My B-PER (8|(0)
mother I-PER 8)
and O -
an O -
old O -
riding O -
horse O -
of O -
our B-PER (18|(3)
master I-PER 18)
’s O -
were O -
also O -
standing O -
near O -
, O -
and O -
seemed O -
to O -
know O -
all O -
about O -
it O -
. O -

“ O -
They O -
have O -
found O -
a O -
hare O -
, O -
” O -
said O -
my B-PER (8|(0)
mother I-PER 8)
, O -
“ O -
and O -
if O -
they O -
come O -
this O -
way O -
we O -
shall O -
see O -
the O -
hunt O -
. O -
” O -

And O -
soon O -
the O -
dogs O -
were O -
all O -
tearing O -
down O -
the O -
field O -
of O -
young O -
wheat O -
next O -
to O -
ours O -
. O -

I O -
never O -
heard O -
such O -
a O -
noise O -
as O -
they O -
made O -
. O -

They O -
did O -
not O -
bark O -
, O -
nor O -
howl O -
, O -
nor O -
whine O -
, O -
but O -
kept O -
on O -
a O -
“ O -

” O -
at O -
the O -
top O -
of O -
their O -
voices O -
. O -

After O -
them O -
came O -
a B-PER (33

, O -
some B-PER (34

snorted O -
and O -
looked O -
eagerly O -
after O -
them O -
, O -
and O -
we B-PER (12|(12)
young I-PER -
colts I-PER 12)
wanted O -
to O -
be O -
galloping O -
with O -
them O -
, O -
but O -
they O -
were O -
soon O -
away O -
into O -
the O -
fields O -
lower O -
down O -
; O -
here O -
it O -
seemed O -
as O -
if O -
they O -
had O -
come O -
to O -
a O -
stand O -
; O -
the O -
dogs O -
left O -
off O -
barking O -
, O -
and O -
ran O -
about O -
every O -
way O -
with O -
their O -
noses O -
to O -
the O -
ground O -
. O -

“ O -
They O -
have O -
lost O -
the O -
scent O -
, O -
” O -
said O -
the B-PER (31
old I-PER -
horse I-PER 31)
; O -
“ O -
perhaps O -
the O -
hare O -
will O -
get O -
off O -
. O -
” O -

“ O -
What O -
hare O -
? O -
” O -

I O -
said O -
. O -

“ O -
Oh O -
! O -

I O -
do O -
n’t O -
know O -
what O -
hare O -
; O -
likely O -
enough O -
it O -
may O -
be O -
one O -
of O -
our O -
own O -
hares O -
out O -
of O -
the O -
woods O -
; O -
any O -
hare O -
they O -
can O -
find O -
will O -
do O -
for O -
the O -
dogs O -
and O -
men B-PER (37)
to O -
run O -
after O -
; O -
” O -
and O -
before O -
long O -
the O -
dogs O -
began O -
their O -
“ O -
yo O -
! O -

yo O -
, O -
o O -
, O -
o O -
! O -
” O -
again O -
, O -
and O -
back O -
they O -
came O -
altogether O -
at O -
full O -
speed O -
, O -
making O -
straight O -
for O -
our O -
meadow O -
at O -
the O -
part O -
where O -
the O -
high O -
bank O -
and O -
hedge O -
overhang O -
the O -
brook O -
. O -

“ O -
Now O -
we O -
shall O -
see O -
the O -
hare O -
, O -
” O -
said O -
my B-PER (8|(0)
mother I-PER 8)
; O -
and O -
just O -
then O -
a O -
hare O -
wild O -
with O -
fright O -
rushed O -
by O -
and O -
made O -
for O -
the O -
woods O -
. O -

On O -
came O -
the O -
dogs O -
; O -
they O -
burst O -
over O -
the O -
bank O -
, O -
leaped O -
the O -
stream O -
, O -
and O -
came O -
dashing O -
across O -
the O -
field O -
followed O -
by O -
the B-PER (33
huntsmen I-PER 33)
. O -

Six B-PER (39
or I-PER -
eight I-PER -
men I-PER 39)
leaped O -
their O -
horses O -
clean O -
over O -
, O -
close O -
upon O -
the O -
dogs O -
. O -

The O -
hare O -
tried O -
to O -
get O -
through O -
the O -
fence O -
; O -
it O -
was O -
too O -
thick O -
, O -
and O -
she O -
turned O -
sharp O -
round O -
to O -
make O -
for O -
the O -
road O -
, O -
but O -
it O -
was O -
too O -
late O -
; O -
the O -
dogs O -
were O -
upon O -
her O -
with O -
their O -
wild O -
cries O -
; O -
we O -
heard O -
one O -
shriek O -
, O -
and O -
that O -
was O -
the O -
end O -
of O -
her O -
. O -

One O -
of O -
the B-PER (33
huntsmen I-PER 33)|43)
rode O -
up O -
and O -
whipped O -
off O -
the O -
dogs O -
, O -
who O -
would O -
soon O -
have O -
torn O -
her O -
to O -
pieces O -
. O -

He O -
held O -
her O -
up O -
by O -
the O -
leg O -
torn O -
and O -
bleeding O -
, O -
and O -
all B-PER (33
the I-PER -
gentlemen I-PER 33)
seemed O -
well O -
pleased O -
. O -

As O -
for O -
me O -
, O -
I O -
was O -
so O -
astonished O -
that O -
I O -
did O -
not O -
at O -
first O -
see O -
what O -
was O -
going O -
on O -
by O -
the O -
brook O -
; O -
but O -
when O -
I O -
did O -
look O -
there O -
was O -
a O -
sad O -
sight O -
; O -
two B-PER (44
fine I-PER -
horses I-PER 44)
were O -
down O -
, O -
one O -
was O -
struggling O -
in O -
the O -
stream O -
, O -
and O -
the O -
other O -
was O -
groaning O -
on O -
the O -
grass O -
. O -

One O -
of O -
the B-PER (47
riders I-PER 47)|46)
was O -
getting O -
out O -
of O -
the O -
water O -
covered O -
with O -
mud O -
, O -
the O -
other O -
lay O -
quite O -
still O -
. O -

“ O -
His O -
neck O -
is O -
broke O -
, O -
” O -
said O -
my B-PER (8|(0)
mother I-PER 8)
. O -

“ O -
And O -
serve O -
him O -
right O -
, O -
too O -
, O -
” O -
said O -
one O -
of O -
the B-PER (11
colts I-PER 11)|50)
. O -

I O -
thought O -
the O -
same O -
, O -
but O -
my B-PER (8|(0)
mother I-PER 8)
did O -
not O -
join O -
with O -
us O -
. O -

“ O -
Well O -
, O -
no O -
, O -
” O -
she O -
said O -
, O -
“ O -
you O -
must O -
not O -
say O -
that O -
; O -
but O -
though O -
I O -
am O -
an B-PER (76
old I-PER -
horse I-PER 76)
, O -
and O -
have O -
seen O -
and O -
heard O -
a O -
great O -
deal O -
, O -
I O -
never O -
yet O -
could O -
make O -
out O -
why O -
men B-PER (52)
are O -
so O -
fond O -
of O -
this O -
sport O -
; O -
they O -
often O -
hurt O -
themselves O -
, O -
often O -
spoil O -
good B-PER (53
horses I-PER 53)
, O -
and O -
tear O -
up O -
the O -
fields O -
, O -
and O -
all O -
for O -
a O -
hare O -
or O -
a O -
fox O -
, O -
or O -
a O -
stag O -
, O -
that O -
they O -
could O -
get O -
more O -
easily O -
some O -
other O -
way O -
; O -
but O -
we O -
are O -
only O -
horses B-PER (55)
, O -

and O -
do O -
n’t O -
know O -
. O -
” O -

While O -
my B-PER (8|(0)
mother I-PER 8)
was O -
saying O -
this O -
we O -
stood O -
and O -
looked O -
on O -
. O -

Many O -
of O -
the B-PER (47
riders I-PER 47)
had O -
gone O -
to O -
the B-PER (49
young I-PER -
man I-PER 49)
; O -
but O -
my B-PER (18|(0)
master I-PER -
, I-PER -
who I-PER -
had I-PER -
been I-PER -
watching I-PER -
what I-PER -
was I-PER -
going I-PER -
on I-PER 18)
, O -
was O -
the O -
first O -
to O -
raise O -
him O -
. O -

His O -
head O -
fell O -
back O -
and O -
his O -
arms O -
hung O -
down O -
, O -
and O -
every B-PER (56
one I-PER 56)
looked O -
very O -
serious O -
. O -

There O -
was O -
no O -
noise O -
now O -
; O -
even O -
the O -
dogs O -
were O -
quiet O -
, O -
and O -
seemed O -
to O -
know O -
that O -
something O -
was O -
wrong O -
. O -

They O -
carried O -
him O -
to O -
our B-PER (5|(19|(3)
master I-PER 19)
’s O -
house O -
. O -

I O -
heard O -
afterward O -
that O -
it O -
was O -
young B-PER (49

, O -
the B-PER (68|(57

a B-PER (77

, O -
and O -
the O -
pride O -
of O -
his B-PER (58|(49)

. O -

There O -
was O -
now O -
riding O -
off O -
in O -
all O -
directions O -
to O -
the B-PER (59|(60

no O -

Squire B-PER (57|(63

, O -
to O -
let O -
him O -
know O -
about O -
his B-PER (49|(57)

When O -
Mr. B-PER (61
Bond O -
, O -
the B-PER (69
farrier I-PER 69)
, O -
came O -
to O -
look O -
at O -
the B-PER (64

that I-PER -
lay I-PER -
groaning I-PER -
on I-PER -
the I-PER -

he O -
felt O -
him O -
all O -
over O -

and O -
shook O -
his O -
head O -
; O -
one O -
of O -
his O -
legs O -
was O -
broken O -

Then O -
some O -
one O -
ran O -
to O -
our B-PER (5|(18|(3)
master I-PER 18)
’s O -
house O -
and O -
came O -
back O -
with O -
a O -
gun O -
; O -
presently O -
there O -
was O -
a O -
loud O -
bang O -
and O -
a O -
dreadful O -
shriek O -
, O -
and O -
then O -
all O -
was O -
still O -
; O -
the B-PER (64
black I-PER -
horse I-PER 64)
moved O -
no O -
more O -
. O -

My B-PER (8|(0)
mother I-PER 8)
seemed O -
much O -
troubled O -
; O -
she O -
said O -
she O -
had O -
known O -
that B-PER (64

for O -
years O -

that O -
his O -

was O -
“ B-PER (64

there O -
was O -

ONE O -
THE O -

OF O -
THE O -
WAR O -
No B-PER (1
one I-PER 1)
would O -
have O -
believed O -
in O -
the O -
last O -
years O -
of O -
the O -
nineteenth O -
century O -
that O -
this O -
world O -
was O -
being O -
watched O -
keenly O -
and O -
closely O -
by O -
intelligences O -
greater O -
than O -
man B-PER (3)
's O -
and O -
yet O -
as O -
mortal O -
as O -
his O -
own O -
; O -
that O -
as O -
men B-PER (4)
busied O -
themselves O -
about O -
their O -
various O -
concerns O -
they O -
were O -
scrutinised O -
and O -
studied O -
, O -
perhaps O -
almost O -
as O -
narrowly O -
as O -
a B-PER (5
man I-PER -
with I-PER -
a I-PER -
microscope I-PER 5)
might O -
scrutinise O -
the O -
transient O -

creatures O -
that O -
swarm O -
and O -
multiply O -
in O -
a O -
drop O -
of O -
water O -
. O -

With O -
infinite O -
complacency O -
men B-PER (6)
went O -
to O -
and O -
fro O -
over O -
this O -
globe O -
about O -
their O -
little O -
affairs O -
, O -
serene O -
in O -
their O -
assurance O -
of O -
their O -
empire O -
over O -

. O -

It O -
is O -
possible O -
that O -
the O -
infusoria O -
under O -
the O -
microscope O -
do O -
the O -
same O -
. O -

No B-PER (8
one I-PER 8)
gave O -
a O -
thought O -
to O -
the O -
older O -
worlds O -
of O -
space O -
as O -
sources O -
of O -
human O -
danger O -
, O -
or O -
thought O -
of O -
them O -
only O -
to O -
dismiss O -
the O -
idea O -
of O -
life O -
upon O -
them O -
as O -
impossible O -
or O -
improbable O -
. O -

It O -
is O -
curious O -
to O -
recall O -
some O -
of O -
the O -
mental O -
habits O -
of O -
those O -
departed O -
days O -
. O -

At O -
most O -
terrestrial B-PER (11
men I-PER 11)
fancied O -
there O -
might O -
be O -
other B-PER (12
men I-PER 12)
upon O -
Mars O -
, O -
perhaps O -
inferior O -
to O -
themselves O -
and O -
ready O -
to O -
welcome O -
a O -
missionary O -
enterprise O -
. O -

Yet O -
across O -
the O -
gulf O -
of O -
space O -
, O -
minds O -
that O -
are O -
to O -
our O -
minds O -
as O -
ours O -
are O -
to O -
those O -
of O -
the O -
beasts O -
that O -

, O -
intellects O -
vast O -
and O -
cool O -
and O -
unsympathetic O -
, O -
regarded O -
this O -
earth O -
with O -
envious O -
eyes O -
, O -
and O -
slowly O -
and O -
surely O -
drew O -
their O -
plans O -
against O -
us O -
. O -

And O -
early O -
in O -
the O -
twentieth O -
century O -
came O -
the O -
great O -
disillusionment O -
. O -

The O -
planet O -
Mars O -
, O -
I O -
scarcely O -
need O -
remind O -
the B-PER (18
reader I-PER 18)
, O -
revolves O -
about O -
the O -
sun O -
at O -
a O -
mean O -
distance O -
of O -
140,000,000 O -
miles O -
, O -
and O -
the O -
light O -
and O -
heat O -
it O -
receives O -
from O -
the O -
sun O -
is O -
barely O -
half O -
of O -
that O -
received O -
by O -
this O -
world O -
. O -

It O -
must O -
be O -
, O -
if O -
the O -
nebular O -
hypothesis O -
has O -
any O -
truth O -
, O -
older O -
than O -
our O -
world O -
; O -
and O -
long O -
before O -
this O -
earth O -
ceased O -
to O -
be O -
molten O -
, O -
life O -
upon O -
its O -
surface O -
must O -
have O -
begun O -
its O -
course O -
. O -

The O -
fact O -
that O -
it O -
is O -
scarcely O -
one O -
seventh O -
of O -
the O -
volume O -
of O -
the O -
earth O -
must O -
have O -
accelerated O -
its O -
cooling O -
to O -
the O -
temperature O -
at O -
which O -
life O -
could O -
begin O -
. O -

It O -
has O -
air O -
and O -
water O -
and O -
all O -
that O -
is O -
necessary O -
for O -
the O -
support O -
of O -
animated O -
existence O -
. O -

Yet O -
so O -
vain O -
is O -
man B-PER (21)
, O -
and O -
so O -
blinded O -
by O -
his O -
vanity O -
, O -
that O -
no B-PER (22
writer I-PER 22)
, O -
up O -
to O -
the O -
very O -
end O -
of O -
the O -
nineteenth O -
century O -
, O -
expressed O -
any O -
idea O -
that O -
intelligent O -
life O -
might O -
have O -
developed O -
there O -
far O -
, O -
or O -
indeed O -
at O -
all O -
, O -
beyond O -
its O -
earthly O -
level O -

Nor O -
was O -
it O -
generally O -
understood O -
that O -
since O -
Mars O -
is O -
older O -
than O -
our O -
earth O -
, O -
with O -
scarcely O -
a O -
quarter O -
of O -
the O -
superficial O -
area O -
and O -
remoter O -
from O -
the O -
sun O -
, O -
it O -
necessarily O -
follows O -
that O -
it O -
is O -
not O -
only O -
more O -
distant O -
from O -
time O -
's O -
beginning O -
but O -
nearer O -
its O -
end O -
. O -

The O -
secular O -
cooling O -
that O -
must O -
someday O -
overtake O -
our O -
planet O -
has O -
already O -
gone O -
far O -
indeed O -
with O -
our O -
neighbour O -
. O -

Its O -
physical O -
condition O -
is O -
still O -
largely O -
a O -
mystery O -
, O -
but O -
we O -
know O -
now O -
that O -
even O -
in O -
its O -
equatorial O -
region O -
the O -
midday O -
temperature O -
barely O -
approaches O -
that O -
of O -
our O -
coldest O -
winter O -
. O -

Its O -
air O -
is O -
much O -
more O -
attenuated O -
than O -
ours O -
, O -
its O -
oceans O -
have O -
shrunk O -
until O -
they O -
cover O -
but O -
a O -
third O -
of O -
its O -
surface O -
, O -
and O -
as O -
its O -
slow O -
seasons O -
change O -
huge O -
snowcaps O -
gather O -
and O -
melt O -
about O -
either O -
pole O -
and O -
periodically O -
inundate O -
its O -
temperate O -
zones O -
. O -

That O -
last O -
stage O -
of O -
exhaustion O -
, O -
which O -
to O -
us O -
is O -
still O -
incredibly O -
remote O -
, O -
has O -
become O -
a O -
present-day O -
problem O -
for O -
the O -
inhabitants O -
of O -
Mars O -
. O -

The O -
immediate O -
pressure O -
of O -
necessity O -
has O -
brightened O -
their O -
intellects O -

enlarged O -
their O -
powers O -

and O -
hardened O -
their O -
hearts O -

And O -

I O -

Ogilvy B-PER (67)
moved O -
about O -
, O -
invisible O -
but O -
audible O -
. O -

Looking O -
through O -
the O -
telescope O -
, O -
one O -
saw O -
a O -
circle O -
of O -
deep O -
blue O -
and O -
the O -
little O -
round O -
planet O -
swimming O -
in O -
the O -
field O -
. O -

It O -
seemed O -
such O -
a O -
little O -
thing O -
, O -
so O -
bright O -
and O -
small O -
and O -
still O -
, O -
faintly O -
marked O -
with O -
transverse O -
stripes O -
, O -
and O -
slightly O -
flattened O -
from O -
the O -
perfect O -

But O -
so O -
little O -
it O -
was O -
, O -
so O -
silvery O -
warm O -
-- O -
a O -
pin O -

- O -
head O -
of O -
light O -
! O -

It O -
was O -
as O -
if O -
it O -
quivered O -
, O -
but O -
really O -
this O -
was O -
the O -
telescope O -
vibrating O -
with O -
the O -
activity O -
of O -
the O -
clockwork O -
that O -
kept O -
the O -
planet O -
in O -
view O -
. O -

As O -
I O -
watched O -
, O -
the O -
planet O -
seemed O -
to O -
grow O -
larger O -
and O -
smaller O -
and O -
to O -
advance O -
and O -
recede O -
, O -
but O -
that O -
was O -
simply O -
that O -
my O -
eye O -
was O -
tired O -
. O -

Forty O -
millions O -

miles O -
it O -
was O -
from O -

more O -
than O -

swims O -

Near O -
it O -
in O -

I O -
remember O -
, O -
were O -
three O -
faint O -
points O -
of O -
light O -
, O -
three O -
telescopic O -
stars O -
infinitely O -
remote O -
, O -
and O -
all O -
around O -
it O -
was O -
the O -
unfathomable O -
darkness O -
of O -
empty O -

. O -

You O -
know O -
how O -
that O -
blackness O -
looks O -
on O -
a O -
frosty O -
starlight O -

In O -
a O -
telescope O -
it O -
seems O -
far O -
profounder O -
. O -

And O -
invisible O -
to O -
me O -
because O -
it O -
was O -
so O -
remote O -
and O -
small O -
, O -
flying O -
swiftly O -
and O -
steadily O -
towards O -
me O -
across O -
that O -
incredible O -
distance O -
, O -
drawing O -
nearer O -
every O -
minute O -

many O -
thousands O -

came O -
the O -

were O -
sending O -

the O -

that O -
was O -
to O -
bring O -
so O -
much O -
struggle O -

calamity O -

death O -
to O -
the O -
earth O -

I O -
never O -

as O -
I O -
watched O -

no O -

my O -

I O -
was O -

feeling O -
my O -

One O -

on O -
the O -

I O -

As O -
I O -
passed O -
the O -

always O -
be O -

with O -

was O -
seized O -
with O -
a O -
keen O -
desire O -
to O -
see O -
Holmes B-PER (1)
again O -
, O -
and O -
to O -
know O -
how O -
he O -
was O -
employing O -
his O -
extraordinary O -
powers O -
. O -

His O -
rooms O -
were O -
brilliantly O -
lit O -
, O -
and O -
, O -
even O -
as O -
I O -
looked O -
up O -

saw O -

twice O -
in O -
a O -

He O -
was O -
pacing O -
the O -

swiftly O -
, O -
eagerly O -
, O -
with O -
his O -
head O -
sunk O -
upon O -
his O -

and O -
his O -
hands O -
clasped O -
behind O -

To O -

every O -
mood O -

his O -
attitude O -

manner O -
told O -
their O -

story O -

He O -
was O -
at O -
work O -
again O -
. O -

He O -
had O -
risen O -
out O -
of O -
his O -
drug-created O -
dreams O -
and O -
was O -
hot O -
upon O -
the O -
scent O -
of O -
some O -
new O -
problem O -
. O -

I O -
rang O -
the O -
bell O -
and O -
was O -
shown O -
up O -
to O -
the O -
chamber O -
which O -
had O -
formerly O -
been O -
in O -
part O -
my O -
own O -
. O -

His O -
manner O -
was O -
not O -
effusive O -
. O -

It O -
seldom O -
was O -
; O -
but O -
he O -
was O -
glad O -
, O -
I O -
think O -
, O -
to O -
see O -
me O -
. O -

With O -
hardly O -
a O -
word O -
spoken O -
, O -
but O -
with O -
a O -
kindly O -
eye O -
, O -
he O -
waved O -
me O -
to O -
an O -
armchair O -

threw O -
across O -
his O -
case O -
of O -
cigars O -

and O -
indicated O -
a O -
spirit O -

and O -
a O -
gasogene O -
in O -
the O -
corner O -
. O -

Then O -
he O -
stood O -
before O -
the O -
fire O -
and O -
looked O -
me O -
over O -
in O -
his O -
singular O -
introspective O -
fashion O -
. O -

" O -

I O -

in O -

You O -
did O -
not O -
tell O -
me O -
that O -

to O -

into O -

I O -
know O -
that O -

yourself O -

that O -

, O -
" O -
said O -
I O -
, O -
" O -
this O -
is O -
too O -
much O -
. O -

You O -
would O -
certainly O -
have O -
been O -
burned O -
, O -
had O -
you O -
lived O -
a O -
few O -
centuries O -
ago O -
. O -

It O -
is O -
true O -
that O -
I O -
had O -
a O -
country O -
walk O -
on O -
Thursday O -
and O -
came O -
home O -
in O -
a O -
dreadful O -
mess O -
, O -
but O -
as O -
I O -
have O -
changed O -
my O -
clothes O -
I O -
ca O -
n't O -
imagine O -
how O -
you O -
deduce O -
it O -
. O -

As O -
to O -
Mary B-PER (23
Jane I-PER 23)
, O -
she O -
is O -
incorrigible O -
, O -
and O -
my B-PER (25|(3)
wife I-PER 25)
has O -
given O -
her O -
notice O -
, O -
but O -
there O -
, O -
again O -
, O -
I O -
fail O -
to O -
see O -
how O -
you O -
work O -
it O -
out O -
. O -
" O -

He O -
chuckled O -
to O -
himself O -
and O -
rubbed O -
his O -
long O -
, O -
nervous O -
hands O -
together O -
. O -

" O -
It O -
is O -
simplicity O -
itself O -
, O -
" O -
said O -
he O -
; O -
" O -
my O -
eyes O -
tell O -
me O -
that O -
on O -
the O -
inside O -

strikes O -
it O -

the O -
leather O -

scored O -

six O -

crusted O -
mud O -
from O -
it O -

Hence O -
, O -
you O -
see O -
, O -
my O -
double O -
deduction O -
that O -
you O -
had O -
been O -
out O -
in O -
vile O -
weather O -

that O -
you O -
had O -
a O -

I O -
could O -
not O -

laughing O -
at O -
the O -
ease O -
with O -

I O -

your O -
reasons O -

" O -
I O -

" O -
the O -
thing O -

to O -

so O -

it O -
myself O -

at O -

I O -
am O -
baffled O -

your O -

CHAPTER O -
I O -
When O -
I O -
was O -
a B-PER (63
small I-PER -
boy I-PER 63)
at O -
the O -
beginning O -
of O -
the O -
century O -
I O -
remember O -
an O -
old O -
man O -
who O -
wore O -
knee-breeches O -
and O -
worsted O -
stockings O -
, O -
and O -
who O -
used O -
to O -
hobble O -
about O -
the O -
street O -
of O -
our O -
village O -
with O -
the O -
help O -
of O -
a O -
stick O -
. O -

He O -
must O -
have O -
been O -
getting O -
on O -
for O -
eighty O -
in O -
the O -
year O -
1807 O -
, O -
earlier O -
than O -
which O -
date O -
I O -
suppose O -
I O -
can O -
hardly O -
remember O -
him O -
, O -
for O -
I O -
was O -
born O -
in O -
1802 O -
. O -

A O -
few O -
white O -
locks O -
hung O -
about O -
his O -
ears O -
, O -
his O -
shoulders O -
were O -
bent O -
and O -
his O -
knees O -
feeble O -
, O -
but O -
he O -
was O -
still O -
hale O -
, O -
and O -
was O -
much O -
respected O -
in O -
our O -
little O -
world O -
of O -
Paleham O -
. O -

His O -
name O -
was O -
Pontifex B-PER (1)
. O -

His B-PER (6|(1)
wife I-PER 6)
was O -
said O -
to O -
be O -
his B-PER (64|(1)
master I-PER 64)
; O -
I O -
have O -
been O -
told O -
she O -
brought O -
him O -
a O -
little O -
money O -
, O -
but O -
it O -
can O -
not O -
have O -
been O -
much O -
. O -

She O -
was O -
a O -
tall O -
, O -
square-shouldered O -
person O -
( O -
I O -
have O -
heard O -
my B-PER (7|(0)
father I-PER 7)
call O -
her O -
a B-PER (66
Gothic I-PER -
woman I-PER 66)
) O -
who O -
had O -
insisted O -
on O -
being O -
married O -
to O -
Mr B-PER (1
Pontifex O -
when O -
he O -
was O -
young O -
and O -
too O -
good-natured O -
to O -
say O -
nay O -
to O -
any B-PER (8
woman I-PER -
who I-PER -
wooed I-PER -
him I-PER 8)|65)|(1)
. O -

The B-PER (9
pair I-PER 9)
had O -
lived O -
not O -
unhappily O -
together O -
, O -
for O -
Mr B-PER (1
Pontifex O -
's O -
temper O -
was O -
easy O -
and O -
he O -
soon O -
learned O -
to O -
bow O -
before O -
his B-PER (6|(1)
wife I-PER 6)
's O -
more O -
stormy O -
moods O -
. O -

Mr B-PER (1
Pontifex O -
was O -
a B-PER (67
carpenter I-PER -
by I-PER -
trade I-PER 67)
; O -
he O -
was O -
also O -
at O -
one O -
time O -
parish B-PER (10
clerk I-PER 10)
; O -
when O -
I O -
remember O -
him O -
, O -
however O -
, O -
he O -
had O -
so O -
far O -
risen O -
in O -
life O -
as O -
to O -
be O -
no O -
longer O -
compelled O -
to O -
work O -
with O -
his O -
own O -
hands O -
. O -

In O -
his O -
earlier O -
days O -
he O -
had O -
taught O -
himself O -
to O -
draw O -
. O -

I O -
do O -
not O -
say O -
he O -
drew O -
well O -
, O -
but O -
it O -
was O -
surprising O -
he O -
should O -
draw O -
as O -
well O -
as O -
he O -
did O -
. O -

My O -
father O -
, O -
who O -
took O -
the O -
living O -
of O -
Paleham B-PER (3)
about O -
the O -
year O -
1797 O -
, O -
became O -
possessed O -
of O -
a O -
good O -
many O -
of O -
old O -
Mr B-PER -
Pontifex O -
's O -
drawings O -
, O -
which O -
were O -
always O -
of O -
local O -
subjects O -
, O -
and O -
so O -
unaffectedly O -
painstaking O -
that O -
they O -
might O -
have O -
passed O -
for O -
the O -
work O -
of O -
some B-PER (11
good I-PER -
early I-PER -
master I-PER 11)
. O -

I O -
remember O -
them O -
as O -
hanging O -
up O -
framed O -
and O -
glazed O -
in O -
the O -
study O -
at O -
the O -
Rectory O -
, O -
and O -
tinted O -
, O -
as O -
all O -
else O -
in O -
the O -
room O -
was O -
tinted O -
, O -
with O -
the O -
green O -
reflected O -
from O -
the O -
fringe O -
of O -
ivy O -
leaves O -
that O -
grew O -
around O -
the O -
windows O -
. O -

I O -
wonder O -
how O -
they O -
will O -
actually O -
cease O -
and O -
come O -
to O -
an O -
end O -
as O -
drawings O -
, O -
and O -
into O -
what O -
new O -
phases O -
of O -
being O -
they O -
will O -
then O -
enter O -
. O -

Not O -
content O -
with O -
being O -
an B-PER (14
artist I-PER 14)
, O -
Mr B-PER (1
Pontifex O -
must O -
needs O -
also O -
be O -
a B-PER (68
musician I-PER 68)
. O -

He O -
built O -
the O -
organ O -
in O -
the O -
church O -
with O -
his O -
own O -
hands O -
, O -
and O -
made O -
a O -
smaller O -
one O -
which O -
he O -
kept O -
in O -
his O -
own O -
house O -
. O -

He O -
could O -
play O -
as O -
much O -
as O -
he O -
could O -
draw O -
, O -
not O -
very O -
well O -
according O -
to O -
professional O -
standards O -
, O -
but O -
much O -
better O -
than O -
could O -
have O -
been O -
expected O -
. O -

I O -
myself O -
showed O -
a O -
taste O -
for O -
music O -
at O -
an O -
early O -
age O -
, O -
and O -
old O -
Mr B-PER -
Pontifex O -
on O -
finding O -
it O -
out O -
, O -
as O -
he O -
soon O -
did O -
, O -
became O -
partial O -
to O -
me O -
in O -
consequence O -
. O -

It O -
may O -
be O -
thought O -
that O -
with O -
so O -
many O -
irons O -
in O -
the O -
fire O -
he O -
could O -
hardly O -
be O -
a B-PER (59
very I-PER -
thriving I-PER -
man I-PER 59)
, O -
but O -
this O -
was O -
not O -
the O -
case O -
. O -

His B-PER (17|(1)
father I-PER 17)
had O -
been O -
a B-PER (69
day I-PER -
labourer I-PER 69)
, O -
and O -
he O -
had O -
himself O -
begun O -
life O -
with O -
no O -
other O -
capital O -
than O -
his O -
good O -
sense O -
and O -
good O -
constitution O -
; O -
now O -
, O -
however O -
, O -
there O -
was O -
a O -
goodly O -
show O -
of O -
timber O -
about O -
his O -
yard O -
, O -
and O -
a O -
look O -
of O -
solid O -
comfort O -
over O -
his O -
whole O -
establishment O -
. O -

Towards O -
the O -
close O -
of O -
the O -
eighteenth O -
century O -
and O -
not O -
long O -
before O -
my B-PER (7|(0)
father I-PER 7)
came O -
to O -
Paleham O -
, O -
he O -
had O -
taken O -
a O -
farm O -
of O -
about O -
ninety O -
acres O -
, O -
thus O -
making O -
a O -
considerable O -
rise O -
in O -
life O -
. O -

Along O -

the O -
farm O -

shadows O -
and O -
made O -
the O -
silence O -
audible O -
. O -

A O -
tear O -
wandered O -
down O -
his O -
brown O -
cheek O -
. O -

They O -
were O -
at O -
supper O -
now O -
, O -
he O -
whispered O -
-- O -
the B-PER (3
father I-PER 3)
and O -
old B-PER (4
mother I-PER 4)
, O -
away O -
back O -
yonder O -
beyond O -
the O -
night O -
. O -

They O -
were O -
far O -
away O -
; O -
they O -
would O -
never O -
be O -
as O -
near O -
as O -
once O -
they O -
had O -
been O -
, O -
for O -
he O -
had O -
stepped O -
into O -
the O -
world O -
. O -

And O -
the O -
cat O -
and O -
Old B-PER (6
Billy I-PER 6)
-- O -
ah O -
, O -
but O -
the O -
world O -
was O -
a O -
lonely O -
thing O -
, O -
so O -
wide O -
and O -
tall O -
and O -
empty O -
! O -

And O -
so O -
bare O -
, O -
so O -
bitter O -
bare O -
! O -

Somehow O -
he O -
had O -
never O -
dreamed O -
of O -
the O -
world O -
as O -
lonely O -
before O -
; O -
he O -
had O -
fared O -
forth O -
to O -
beckoning O -
hands O -
and O -
luring O -
, O -
and O -
to O -
the O -
eager O -
hum O -
of O -
human O -
voices O -
, O -
as O -
of O -
some O -
great O -
, O -
swelling O -
music O -
. O -

Yet O -
now O -
he O -
was O -
alone O -
; O -
the O -
empty O -
night O -
was O -
closing O -
all O -
about O -
him O -
here O -
in O -
a O -
strange O -
land O -
, O -
and O -
he O -
was O -
afraid O -
. O -

The O -
bundle O -
with O -
his O -
earthly O -
treasure O -
had O -
hung O -
heavy O -
and O -
heavier O -
on O -
his O -
shoulder O -
; O -
his O -
little O -
horde O -
of O -
money O -
was O -
tightly O -
wadded O -
in O -
his O -
sock O -
, O -
and O -
the O -
school O -
lay O -
hidden O -
somewhere O -
far O -
away O -
in O -
the O -
shadows O -
. O -

He O -
wondered O -
how O -
far O -
it O -
was O -
; O -
he O -
looked O -
and O -
harkened O -
, O -
starting O -
at O -
his O -
own O -
heartbeats O -
, O -
and O -
fearing O -
more O -
and O -
more O -
the O -
long O -
dark O -
fingers O -
of O -
the O -
night O -
. O -

Then O -
of O -
a O -
sudden O -
up O -
from O -
the O -
darkness O -
came O -
music O -
. O -

It O -
was O -
human O -
music O -
, O -
but O -
of O -
a O -
wildness O -
and O -
a O -
weirdness O -
that O -
startled O -
the B-PER (1
boy I-PER 1)
as O -
it O -
fluttered O -
and O -
danced O -
across O -
the O -
dull O -
red O -
waters O -
of O -
the O -
swamp O -
. O -

He O -
hesitated O -
, O -
then O -
impelled O -
by O -
some O -
strange O -
power O -
, O -
left O -
the O -
highway O -
and O -
slipped O -
into O -
the O -
forest O -
of O -
the O -
swamp O -
, O -
shrinking O -
, O -
yet O -
following O -
the O -
song O -
hungrily O -
and O -
half O -
forgetting O -
his O -
fear O -
. O -

A O -
harsher O -
, O -
shriller O -
note O -
struck O -
in O -
as O -
of O -
many O -
and O -
ruder O -
voices O -
; O -
but O -
above O -
it O -
flew O -
the O -
first O -
sweet O -
music O -
, O -
birdlike O -
, O -
abandoned O -
, O -
and O -
the B-PER (1
boy I-PER 1)
crept O -
closer O -
. O -

The O -
cabin O -
crouched O -
ragged O -
and O -
black O -
at O -
the O -
edge O -
of O -
black O -
waters O -
. O -

An O -
old O -
chimney O -
leaned O -
drunkenly O -
against O -
it O -
, O -
raging O -
with O -
fire O -
and O -
smoke O -
, O -
while O -
through O -
the O -
chinks O -
winked O -
red O -
gleams O -
of O -
warmth O -
and O -
wild O -
cheer O -
. O -

With O -
a O -
revel O -
of O -
shouting O -
and O -
noise O -
, O -
the O -
music O -
suddenly O -
ceased O -
. O -

Hoarse O -
staccato O -
cries O -
and O -
peals O -
of O -
laughter O -
shook O -
the O -
old O -
hut O -
, O -
and O -
as O -
the B-PER (1
boy I-PER 1)
stood O -
there O -
peering O -
through O -
the O -
black O -
trees O -
, O -
abruptly O -
the O -
door O -
flew O -
open O -
and O -
a O -
flood O -
of O -
light O -
illumined O -
the O -
wood O -
. O -

Amid O -
this O -
mighty O -
halo O -
, O -
as O -
on O -
clouds O -
of O -
flame O -
, O -
a B-PER (13
girl I-PER 13)
was O -
dancing O -
. O -

She O -
was O -
black O -
, O -
and O -
lithe O -
, O -
and O -
tall O -
, O -
and O -
willowy O -
. O -

Her O -
garments O -
twined O -
and O -
flew O -
around O -
the O -
delicate O -
moulding O -
of O -
her O -
dark O -
, O -
young O -
, O -
half-naked O -
limbs O -
. O -

A O -
heavy O -
mass O -
of O -
hair O -
clung O -
motionless O -
to O -
her O -
wide O -
forehead O -
. O -

Her O -
arms O -
twirled O -
and O -
flickered O -
, O -
and O -
body O -
and O -
soul O -
seemed O -
quivering O -
and O -
whirring O -
in O -
the O -
poetry O -
of O -
her O -
motion O -
. O -

As O -
she O -
danced O -
she O -
sang O -
. O -

He O -
heard O -
her O -
voice O -
as O -
before O -
, O -
fluttering O -
like O -
a O -
bird O -
's O -
in O -
the O -
full O -
sweetness O -
of O -
her O -
utter O -
music O -
. O -

It O -
was O -
no O -
tune O -
nor O -
melody O -
, O -
it O -
was O -
just O -
formless O -
, O -
boundless O -
music O -
. O -

The B-PER (1
boy I-PER 1)
forgot O -
himself O -
and O -
all O -
the O -
world O -
besides O -
. O -

All O -
his O -
darkness O -
was O -
sudden O -
light O -
; O -
dazzled O -
he O -
crept O -
forward O -
, O -
bewildered O -
, O -
fascinated O -
, O -
until O -
with O -
one O -
last O -
wild O -
whirl O -
the B-PER (13
elf-girl I-PER 13)
paused O -
. O -

The O -
crimson O -
light O -
fell O -
full O -
upon O -
the O -
warm O -
and O -
velvet O -
bronze O -
of O -
her O -
face O -
-- O -
her O -
midnight O -
eyes O -
were O -
aglow O -
, O -
her O -
full O -
purple O -
lips O -
apart O -
, O -
her O -
half O -
hid O -
bosom O -
panting O -
, O -
and O -
all O -
the O -
music O -
dead O -
. O -

Involuntarily O -
the B-PER (1
boy I-PER 1)
gave O -
a O -
gasping O -
cry O -
and O -
awoke O -
to O -
swamp O -
and O -
night O -
and O -
fire O -
, O -
while O -
a O -
white O -
face O -
, O -
drawn O -
, O -
red-eyed O -
, O -
peered O -
outward O -
from O -
some O -
hidden O -
throng O -
within O -
the O -
cabin O -
. O -

" O -
Who O -
's O -
that O -
? O -
" O -
a O -
harsh O -
voice O -
cried O -
. O -

" O -
Where O -
? O -
" O -

" O -
Who O -
is O -
it O -
? O -
" O -
and O -
pale O -
crowding O -
faces O -
blurred O -
the O -
light O -
. O -

The B-PER (1
boy I-PER 1)
wheeled O -
blindly O -
and O -
fled O -
in O -
terror O -
stumbling O -
through O -
the O -
swamp O -
, O -
hearing O -
strange O -
sounds O -
and O -
feeling O -
stealthy O -
creeping O -
hands O -
and O -
arms O -
and O -
whispering O -
voices O -
. O -

On O -
he O -
toiled O -
in O -
mad O -
haste O -
, O -
struggling O -
toward O -
the O -
road O -
and O -
losing O -
it O -
until O -
finally O -
beneath O -
the O -
shadows O -
of O -
a O -
mighty O -
oak O -
he O -
sank O -
exhausted O -
. O -

There O -
he O -
lay O -
a O -
while O -
trembling O -
and O -
at O -
last O -
drifted O -
into O -
dreamless O -
sleep O -
. O -

It O -
was O -
morning O -
when O -
he O -
awoke O -
and O -
threw O -
a O -
startled O -
glance O -
upward O -
to O -
the O -
twisted O -
branches O -
of O -
the O -
oak O -
that O -
bent O -
above O -
, O -
sifting O -
down O -
sunshine O -
on O -
his O -
brown O -
face O -
and O -
close O -
curled O -
hair O -
. O -

Slowly O -
he O -
remembered O -
the O -
loneliness O -
, O -
the O -
fear O -
and O -
wild O -
running O -
through O -
the O -
dark O -
. O -

He O -
laughed O -
in O -
the O -
bold O -
courage O -
of O -
day O -
and O -
stretched O -
himself O -
. O -

Then O -
suddenly O -
he O -
bethought O -
him O -
again O -
of O -
that O -
vision O -
of O -
the O -
night O -
-- O -
the O -
waving O -
arms O -
and O -
flying O -
limbs O -
of O -
the B-PER (13
girl I-PER 13)
, O -
and O -
her O -
great O -
black O -
eyes O -
looking O -
into O -
the O -
night O -
and O -
calling O -
him O -
. O -

He O -
could O -
hear O -
her O -
now O -
, O -
and O -
hear O -
that O -
wondrous O -
savage O -
music O -
. O -

Had O -
it O -
been O -
real O -
? O -

Had O -
he O -
dreamed O -
? O -

Or O -
had O -
it O -
been O -
some O -
witch-vision O -
of O -
the O -
night O -
, O -
come O -
to O -
tempt O -
and O -
lure O -
him O -
to O -
his O -
undoing O -
? O -

Where O -
was O -
that O -
black O -
and O -
flaming O -
cabin O -
? O -

Where O -
was O -
the B-PER (13

-- O -
the B-PER (24
soul I-PER -
that I-PER -
had I-PER -
called I-PER -
him I-PER 24)|(1)
? O -

_ O -
She O -
_ O -
must O -
have O -
been O -
real O -
; O -
she O -
had O -
to O -
live O -
and O -
dance O -
and O -
sing O -
; O -
he O -
must O -
again O -
look O -
into O -
the O -
mystery O -
of O -
her O -
great O -
eyes O -
. O -

And O -
he O -
sat O -
up O -
in O -
sudden O -
determination O -
, O -
and O -
, O -
lo O -
! O -

gazed O -
straight O -
into O -
the O -
very O -
eyes O -
of O -
his O -
dreaming O -
. O -

She O -
sat O -
not O -
four O -
feet O -
from O -
him O -
, O -
leaning O -
against O -
the O -
great O -
tree O -
, O -
her O -
eyes O -
now O -
languorously O -
abstracted O -
, O -
now O -
alert O -
and O -
quizzical O -
with O -
mischief O -
. O -

She O -
seemed O -
but O -
half-clothed O -
, O -
and O -
her O -
warm O -
, O -
dark O -
flesh O -
peeped O -
furtively O -
through O -
the O -
rent O -
gown O -
; O -
her O -
thick O -
, O -
crisp O -
hair O -
was O -
frowsy O -
and O -
rumpled O -
, O -
and O -
the O -
long O -
curves O -
of O -
her O -
bare O -
young O -
arms O -
gleamed O -
in O -
the O -
morning O -
sunshine O -
, O -
glowing O -
with O -
vigor O -
and O -
life O -
. O -

A O -
little O -
mocking O -
smile O -
came O -
and O -
sat O -
upon O -
her O -
lips O -
. O -

" O -
What O -
you O -
run O -
for O -
? O -
" O -
she O -
asked O -

with O -

in O -
her O -
eyes O -

" O -
Because O -

" O -
he O -
hesitated O -
, O -
and O -
his O -
cheeks O -
grew O -
hot O -
. O -

" O -
I O -

" O -
she O -
said O -

with O -
impish O -
glee O -

laughing O -
low O -
music O -
. O -

" O -
Why O -

" O -
he O -
challenged O -

sturdily O -

" O -

He O -
bridled O -

" O -

He O -
looked O -
at O -

a O -
curious O -
awe O -

" O -
I O -
do O -

he O -
asserted O -

she O -
tossed O -
her O -
head O -

her O -
eyes O -
grew O -
scornful O -

" O -
Who O -

Her O -
eyes O -
grew O -
soft O -

He O -
watched O -
her O -
silently O -
, O -
till O -
, O -
waking O -
from O -
her O -
daydream O -
, O -
she O -
abruptly O -
asked O -

" O -
Where O -

He O -
looked O -
at O -
her O -

she O -
seemed O -
matter-of-fact O -

" O -
It O -

She O -
looked O -
up O -
at O -
its O -

through O -
the O -

answered O -
the B-PER (1

fumbling O -
at O -
his O -

then O -
, O -
timidly O -
: O -
" O -

" O -
Yes O -

she O -

watched O -
him O -
with O -
eager O -

Untying O -
the O -

he O -

he O -
asked O -

Without O -
a O -

she O -
bounded O -
up O -

flitted O -
off O -

in O -
the O -

glancing O -
in O -

out O -

she O -

she O -
cried O -

Obediently O -
he O -
bent O -
over O -
the O -

He O -
took O -
a O -

then O -
to O -

the O -

them O -
both O -

A O -
