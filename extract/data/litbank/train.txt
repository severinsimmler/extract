The O -
" O -
Red O -
Death O -
" O -
had O -
long O -
devastated O -
the O -
country O -
. O -

No O -
pestilence O -
had O -
ever O -
been O -
so O -
fatal O -
, O -
or O -
so O -
hideous O -
. O -

Blood O -
was O -
its O -
Avatar O -
and O -
its O -
seal O -
-- O -
the O -
redness O -
and O -
the O -
horror O -
of O -
blood O -
. O -

There O -
were O -
sharp O -
pains O -
, O -
and O -
sudden O -

, O -
and O -
then O -
profuse O -
bleeding O -
at O -
the O -

The O -
scarlet O -

upon O -
the O -
body O -
and O -
especially O -
upon O -
the O -
face O -
of O -
the B-PER (1

, O -
were O -
the O -
pest O -

which O -
shut O -
him O -
out O -
from O -
the O -
aid O -
and O -
from O -
the O -
sympathy O -
of O -
his B-PER (2|(1)

And O -
the O -
whole O -
seizure O -
, O -
progress O -
and O -
termination O -
of O -
the O -
disease O -
, O -
were O -
the O -
incidents O -
of O -
half O -
an O -
hour O -
. O -

But O -
the B-PER -
Prince I-PER -
Prospero B-PER (3)
was O -
happy O -
and O -
dauntless O -
and O -
sagacious O -
. O -

When O -
his O -
dominions O -
were O -
half O -
depopulated O -
, O -
he O -
summoned O -
to O -
his O -
presence O -
a O -
thousand O -
hale O -
and O -
light-hearted O -
friends O -
from O -
among O -
the B-PER (6
knights I-PER 6)
and O -
dames O -
of O -
his O -
court O -
, O -
and O -
with O -
these O -
retired O -
to O -
the O -
deep O -
seclusion O -
of O -
one O -
of O -
his O -
castellated O -
abbeys O -
. O -

This O -
was O -
an O -
extensive O -
and O -
magnificent O -
structure O -
, O -
the O -
creation O -
of O -
the B-PER (3
prince I-PER 3)
's O -
own O -
eccentric O -
yet O -
august O -
taste O -
. O -

A O -
strong O -
and O -
lofty O -
wall O -
girdled O -
it O -
in O -
. O -

This O -
wall O -
had O -
gates O -

The B-PER (5

, O -
having O -
entered O -
, O -
brought O -
furnaces O -
and O -
massy O -
hammers O -
and O -
welded O -
the O -
bolts O -
. O -

They O -
resolved O -
to O -
leave O -
means O -
neither O -
of O -

nor O -
egress O -
to O -
the O -
sudden O -
impulses O -
of O -
despair O -
or O -
of O -
frenzy O -
from O -
within O -
. O -

The O -
abbey O -
was O -
amply O -
provisioned O -
. O -

With O -
such O -
precautions O -
the B-PER (5
courtiers I-PER 5)
might O -
bid O -
defiance O -
to O -
contagion O -
. O -

The O -
external O -
world O -
could O -
take O -
care O -
of O -
itself O -
. O -

In O -
the O -
meantime O -
it O -
was O -
folly O -
to O -
grieve O -
, O -
or O -
to O -
think O -
. O -

The B-PER (3
prince I-PER 3)
had O -
provided O -
all O -
the O -
appliances O -
of O -
pleasure O -
. O -

There O -
were O -
buffoons B-PER (11)
, O -
there O -
were O -

All O -
these O -

were O -

Without O -

It O -
was O -
towards O -
the O -
close O -
of O -
the O -
fifth O -
or O -
sixth O -
month O -
of O -
his O -
seclusion O -
, O -
and O -
while O -
the O -
pestilence O -
raged O -
most O -
furiously O -
abroad O -
, O -
that O -
the B-PER -
Prince I-PER -
Prospero B-PER (3)
entertained O -
his B-PER (5|(3)
thousand I-PER -
friends I-PER 5)
at O -
a O -
masked O -
ball O -
of O -
the O -
most O -
unusual O -
magnificence O -
. O -

It O -
was O -
a O -
voluptuous O -
scene O -
, O -
that O -
masquerade O -
. O -

But O -
first O -
let O -
me O -
tell O -
of O -
the O -
rooms O -
in O -
which O -
it O -
was O -
held O -
. O -

These O -
were O -
seven O -
-- O -
an O -
imperial O -
suite O -
. O -

In O -
many O -
palaces O -
, O -
however O -
, O -
such O -
suites O -
form O -
a O -
long O -
and O -
straight O -
vista O -
, O -
while O -
the O -
folding O -
doors O -
slide O -
back O -
nearly O -
to O -
the O -
walls O -
on O -
either O -
hand O -
, O -
so O -
that O -
the O -
view O -
of O -
the O -
whole O -
extent O -
is O -
scarcely O -
impeded O -
. O -

Here O -
the O -
case O -
was O -
very O -
different O -
, O -
as O -
might O -
have O -
been O -
expected O -
from O -
the B-PER (3
duke I-PER 3)
's O -
love O -
of O -
the O -
_ O -
bizarre O -
_ O -
. O -

The O -
apartments O -
were O -
so O -
irregularly O -
disposed O -
that O -
the O -
vision O -
embraced O -
but O -
little O -
more O -
than O -
one O -
at O -
a O -
time O -
. O -

There O -
was O -
a O -
sharp O -
turn O -
at O -
every O -
twenty O -
or O -
thirty O -
yards O -
, O -
and O -
at O -
each O -
turn O -
a O -
novel O -
effect O -
. O -

To O -
the O -
right O -
and O -
left O -
, O -
in O -
the O -
middle O -
of O -
each O -
wall O -
, O -
a O -
tall O -
and O -
narrow O -
Gothic O -
window O -
looked O -
out O -
upon O -
a O -
closed O -
corridor O -
which O -
pursued O -
the O -
windings O -
of O -
the O -
suite O -
. O -

These O -
windows O -
were O -
of O -
stained O -
glass O -
whose O -
colour O -
varied O -
in O -
accordance O -
with O -
the O -
prevailing O -
hue O -
of O -
the O -
decorations O -
of O -
the O -
chamber O -
into O -
which O -
it O -
opened O -
. O -

That O -
at O -
the O -
eastern O -
extremity O -
was O -
hung O -
, O -
for O -
example O -
in O -
blue O -
-- O -
and O -
vividly O -
blue O -
were O -
its O -
windows O -
. O -

The O -
second O -
chamber O -
was O -
purple O -
in O -
its O -
ornaments O -
and O -
tapestries O -
, O -
and O -
here O -
the O -
panes O -
were O -
purple O -
. O -

The O -
third O -
was O -
green O -
throughout O -
, O -
and O -
so O -
were O -
the O -
casements O -
. O -

The O -
fourth O -
was O -
furnished O -
and O -
lighted O -
with O -
orange O -
-- O -
the O -
fifth O -
with O -
white O -
-- O -
the O -
sixth O -
with O -
violet O -
. O -

The O -
seventh O -
apartment O -
was O -
closely O -
shrouded O -
in O -
black O -
velvet O -
tapestries O -
that O -
hung O -
all O -
over O -
the O -
ceiling O -
and O -
down O -
the O -
walls O -
, O -
falling O -
in O -
heavy O -
folds O -
upon O -
a O -
carpet O -
of O -
the O -
same O -
material O -
and O -
hue O -
. O -

But O -
in O -
this O -
chamber O -
only O -
, O -
the O -
colour O -
of O -
the O -
windows O -
failed O -
to O -
correspond O -
with O -
the O -
decorations O -
. O -

The O -
panes O -
here O -
were O -
scarlet O -
-- O -
a O -
deep O -
blood O -
colour O -
. O -

Now O -
in O -
no B-PER (27
one I-PER -
of O -
the O -
seven O -
apartments O -
was O -
there O -
any O -
lamp O -
or O -
candelabrum O -
, O -
amid O -
the O -
profusion O -
of O -
golden O -
ornaments O -
that O -
lay O -
scattered O -
to O -
and O -
fro O -
or O -
depended O -
from O -
the O -
roof O -
. O -

There O -
was O -
no O -
light O -
of O -
any O -
kind O -
emanating O -
from O -
lamp O -
or O -
candle O -
within O -
the O -
suite O -
of O -
chambers O -
. O -

But O -
in O -
the O -
corridors O -
that O -
followed O -
the O -
suite O -
, O -
there O -
stood O -
, O -
opposite O -
to O -
each O -
window O -
, O -
a O -
heavy O -
tripod O -
, O -
bearing O -
a O -
brazier O -
of O -
fire O -
, O -
that O -
projected O -
its O -
rays O -
through O -
the O -
tinted O -
glass O -
and O -
so O -
glaringly O -
illumined O -
the O -
room O -
. O -

And O -
thus O -
were O -
produced O -
a O -
multitude O -
of O -
gaudy O -
and O -
fantastic O -
appearances O -
. O -

But O -
in O -
the O -
western O -
or O -
black O -
chamber O -
the O -
effect O -
of O -
the O -
fire-light O -
that O -
streamed O -
upon O -
the O -
dark O -
hangings O -
through O -
the O -
blood-tinted O -
panes O -
, O -
was O -
ghastly O -
in O -
the O -
extreme O -
, O -
and O -
produced O -
so O -
wild O -
a O -
look O -
upon O -
the O -
countenances O -
of O -
those O -
who O -
entered O -
, O -
that O -
there O -
were O -
few O -
of O -
the B-PER (5
company I-PER 5)|29)
bold O -
enough O -
to O -
set O -
foot O -
within O -
its O -
precincts O -
at O -
all O -
. O -

It O -
was O -
in O -
this O -
apartment O -
, O -
also O -
, O -
that O -
there O -
stood O -
against O -
the O -
western O -
wall O -
, O -
a O -
gigantic O -
clock O -
of O -
ebony O -
. O -

Its O -
pendulum O -
swung O -
to O -
and O -
fro O -
with O -
a O -
dull O -
, O -
heavy O -
, O -
monotonous O -
clang O -
; O -
and O -
when O -
the O -
minute-hand O -
made O -
the O -
circuit O -
of O -
the O -
face O -
, O -
and O -
the O -
hour O -
was O -
to O -
be O -
stricken O -
, O -
there O -
came O -
from O -
the O -
brazen O -
lungs O -
of O -
the O -
clock O -
a O -
sound O -
which O -
was O -
clear O -
and O -
loud O -
and O -
deep O -
and O -
exceedingly O -
musical O -
, O -
but O -
of O -
so O -
peculiar O -
a O -
note O -
and O -
emphasis O -
that O -
, O -
at O -
each O -
lapse O -
of O -
an O -
hour O -
, O -
the B-PER (14
musicians I-PER -
of I-PER -
the I-PER -
orchestra I-PER 14)
were O -
constrained O -
to O -
pause O -
, O -
momentarily O -
, O -
in O -
their O -
performance O -
, O -
to O -
harken O -
to O -
the O -
sound O -
; O -
and O -
thus O -
the B-PER (5
waltzers I-PER 5)
perforce O -
ceased O -
their O -
evolutions O -
; O -
and O -
there O -
was O -
a O -
brief O -
disconcert O -
of O -
the B-PER (5
whole I-PER -
gay I-PER -
company I-PER 5)
; O -
and O -
, O -
while O -
the O -
chimes O -
of O -
the O -
clock O -
yet O -
rang O -
, O -
it O -
was O -
observed O -
that O -
the B-PER (30
giddiest I-PER 30)
grew O -
pale O -
, O -
and O -
the B-PER (31
more I-PER -
aged I-PER -
and I-PER -
sedate I-PER 31)
passed O -
their O -
hands O -
over O -
their O -
brows O -
as O -
if O -
in O -
confused O -
revery O -
or O -
meditation O -
. O -

But O -
when O -
the O -
echoes O -
had O -
fully O -
ceased O -
, O -
a O -
light O -
laughter O -
at O -
once O -
pervaded O -
the B-PER (5
assembly I-PER 5)
; O -
the B-PER (14
musicians I-PER 14)
looked O -
at O -
each O -
other O -
and O -
smiled O -
as O -
if O -
at O -
their O -
own O -
nervousness O -
and O -
folly O -
, O -
and O -
made O -
whispering O -
vows O -
, O -
each O -
to O -
the O -
other O -
, O -
that O -
the O -
next O -
chiming O -
of O -
the O -
clock O -
should O -
produce O -
in O -
them O -
no O -
similar O -
emotion O -
; O -
and O -
then O -
, O -
after O -
the O -
lapse O -
of O -
sixty O -
minutes O -
, O -
( O -
which O -
embrace O -
three O -
thousand O -
and O -
six O -
hundred O -
seconds O -
of O -
the O -
Time O -

) O -
there O -
came O -
yet O -
another O -
chiming O -
of O -
the O -
clock O -
, O -
and O -
then O -
were O -
the O -
same O -
disconcert O -
and O -
tremulousness O -
and O -
meditation O -
as O -
before O -
. O -

But O -
, O -
in O -
spite O -
of O -
these O -
things O -
, O -
it O -
was O -
a O -
gay O -
and O -
magnificent O -
revel O -
. O -

The O -
tastes O -
of O -
the B-PER (3
duke I-PER 3)
were O -
peculiar O -
. O -

He O -
had O -
a O -
fine O -
eye O -
for O -
colours O -
and O -
effects O -
. O -

He O -
disregarded O -
the O -
_ O -
decora O -
_ O -
of O -
mere O -
fashion O -
. O -

His O -
plans O -
were O -
bold O -
and O -
fiery O -
, O -
and O -
his O -
conceptions O -
glowed O -
with O -
barbaric O -
lustre O -
. O -

There O -
are O -
some B-PER (32
who I-PER -
would I-PER -
have I-PER -
thought I-PER -
him I-PER (3)
mad I-PER 32)
. O -

His B-PER (5|(3)
followers I-PER 5)
felt O -
that O -
he O -
was O -
not O -
. O -

It O -
was O -
necessary O -
to O -
hear O -
and O -
see O -
and O -
touch O -
him O -
to O -
be O -
_ O -
sure O -
_ O -
that O -
he O -
was O -

He O -
had O -
directed O -

in O -
great O -
part O -
, O -
the O -
movable O -
embellishments O -
of O -
the O -
seven O -

, O -
upon O -
occasion O -
of O -
this O -
great O -
_ O -
fête O -
_ O -
; O -
and O -
it O -
was O -
his O -
own O -
guiding O -
taste O -
which O -
had O -
given O -
character O -
to O -
the B-PER (5
masqueraders I-PER 5)
. O -

Be O -
sure O -
they O -
were O -
grotesque O -
. O -

There O -
were O -
much O -
glare O -
and O -
glitter O -
and O -
piquancy O -
and O -
phantasm O -
-- O -
much O -
of O -
what O -
has O -
been O -
since O -
seen O -
in O -
" O -
Hernani O -
" O -
. O -

There O -
were O -
arabesque O -
figures O -
with O -
unsuited O -
limbs O -
and O -
appointments O -
. O -

There O -
were O -
delirious O -
fancies O -
such O -
as O -
the B-PER (33
madman I-PER 33)
fashions O -
. O -

There O -
were O -
much O -
of O -
the O -
beautiful O -
, O -
much O -
of O -
the O -

much O -
of O -
the O -
_ O -

, O -
something O -
of O -
the O -

, O -
and O -
not O -
a O -
little O -
of O -
that O -
which O -
might O -
have O -
excited O -
disgust O -
. O -

To O -
and O -
fro O -
in O -
the O -
seven O -
chambers O -
there O -
stalked O -
, O -
in O -
fact O -
, O -
a O -
multitude O -
of O -
dreams O -
. O -

And O -
these O -
-- O -
the O -
dreams O -
-- O -
writhed O -
in O -
and O -
about O -
taking O -
hue O -
from O -
the O -
rooms O -
, O -
and O -
causing O -
the O -
wild O -
music O -
of O -
the B-PER (14
orchestra I-PER 14)
to O -
seem O -
as O -
the O -
echo O -
of O -
their O -
steps O -
. O -

And O -
, O -
anon O -
, O -
there O -
strikes O -
the O -
ebony O -
clock O -
which O -
stands O -
in O -
the O -
hall O -
of O -
the O -

. O -

And O -
then O -
, O -
for O -
a O -
moment O -
, O -
all O -
is O -
still O -
, O -
and O -
all O -
is O -
silent O -
save O -
the O -
voice O -
of O -
the O -
clock O -
. O -

The O -
dreams O -
are O -
stiff-frozen O -
as O -
they O -
stand O -
. O -

But O -
the O -
echoes O -
of O -
the O -
chime O -
die O -
away O -
-- O -
they O -
have O -
endured O -
but O -
an O -
instant O -
-- O -
and O -
a O -
light O -
, O -
half-subdued O -
laughter O -
floats O -
after O -
them O -
as O -
they O -
depart O -
. O -

And O -
now O -
again O -
the O -
music O -
swells O -
, O -
and O -
the O -
dreams O -
live O -
, O -
and O -
writhe O -
to O -
and O -
fro O -
more O -
merrily O -
than O -
ever O -
, O -
taking O -
hue O -
from O -
the O -

waning O -
away O -
; O -
and O -
there O -
flows O -
a O -
ruddier O -
light O -
through O -
the O -
blood-coloured O -
panes O -
; O -
and O -
the O -
blackness O -
of O -
the O -
sable O -
drapery O -
appals O -
; O -
and O -
to O -
him O -
whose O -
foot O -
falls O -
upon O -
the O -
sable O -
carpet O -
, O -
there O -
comes O -
from O -
the O -
near O -
clock O -
of O -
ebony O -
a O -
muffled O -
peal O -
more O -
solemnly O -
emphatic O -
than O -
any O -
which O -
reaches O -
_ O -
their O -
_ O -
ears O -
who O -
indulged O -
in O -
the O -
more O -
remote O -
gaieties O -
of O -
the O -
other O -
apartments O -
. O -

But O -
these O -
other O -
apartments O -
were O -
densely O -
crowded O -
, O -
and O -
in O -
them O -
beat O -
feverishly O -
the O -
heart O -
of O -
life O -
. O -

And O -
the O -
revel O -
went O -
whirlingly O -
on O -
, O -
until O -
at O -
length O -
there O -
commenced O -
the O -
sounding O -
of O -
midnight O -
upon O -
the O -
clock O -
. O -

And O -
then O -
the O -
music O -
ceased O -
, O -
as O -
I O -
have O -
told O -
; O -
and O -
the O -
evolutions O -
of O -
the B-PER (5
waltzers I-PER 5)
were O -
quieted O -
; O -
and O -
there O -
was O -
an O -
uneasy O -
cessation O -
of O -
all O -
things O -
as O -
before O -
. O -

But O -
now O -
there O -
were O -
twelve O -
strokes O -
to O -
be O -
sounded O -
by O -
the O -
bell O -
of O -
the O -
clock O -
; O -
and O -
thus O -
it O -
happened O -
, O -
perhaps O -
, O -
that O -
more O -
of O -
thought O -
crept O -
, O -
with O -
more O -
of O -
time O -
, O -
into O -
the O -
meditations O -
of O -
the O -
thoughtful O -
among O -
those B-PER (5

. O -

And O -
thus O -
too O -
, O -
it O -
happened O -
, O -
perhaps O -
, O -
that O -
before O -
the O -
last O -
echoes O -
of O -
the O -
last O -
chime O -
had O -
utterly O -
sunk O -
into O -
silence O -
, O -
there O -
were O -
many O -
individuals O -
in O -
the O -
crowd O -
who O -
had O -
found O -
leisure O -
to O -
become O -
aware O -
of O -
the O -
presence O -
of O -
a O -
masked O -
figure O -
which O -
had O -
arrested O -
the O -
attention O -
of O -
no B-PER (39
single I-PER -
individual I-PER 39)
before O -
. O -

And O -
the O -
rumour O -
of O -
this B-PER (38
new I-PER -
presence I-PER 38)
having O -
spread O -
itself O -
whisperingly O -
around O -
, O -
there O -
arose O -
at O -
length O -
from O -
the B-PER (5

a O -
buzz O -
, O -
or O -
murmur O -
, O -
expressive O -
of O -
disapprobation O -

then O -
, O -
finally O -
, O -
of O -
terror O -
, O -
of O -
horror O -
, O -
and O -
of O -
disgust O -
. O -

In O -
an O -
assembly O -
of O -
phantasms O -
such O -
as O -
I O -
have O -
painted O -
, O -
it O -
may O -
well O -
be O -
supposed O -
that O -
no O -
ordinary O -
appearance O -
could O -
have O -
excited O -
such O -
sensation O -
. O -

In O -
truth O -
the O -
masquerade O -
licence O -
of O -
the O -
night O -
was O -
nearly O -
unlimited O -
; O -
but O -
the B-PER (38

had O -
out-Heroded O -
Herod B-PER (40)

There O -
are O -

in O -
the O -

of O -
the B-PER (41

which O -
can O -
not O -

Even O -
with O -

equally O -

there O -
are O -
matters O -

which O -
no O -

be O -
made O -
. O -

The B-PER (5

, O -
indeed O -
, O -
seemed O -
now O -
deeply O -
to O -
feel O -
that O -
in O -
the O -
costume O -
and O -
bearing O -
of O -
the B-PER (38
stranger I-PER 38)
neither O -
wit O -
nor O -

existed O -
. O -

The B-PER (38

was O -
tall O -
and O -
gaunt O -
, O -
and O -
shrouded O -
from O -
head O -
to O -
foot O -
in O -
the O -
habiliments O -
of O -
the O -

The O -
mask O -
which O -
concealed O -
the O -
visage O -
was O -
made O -
so O -
nearly O -
to O -
resemble O -
the O -
countenance O -
of O -
a O -
stiffened O -
corpse O -
that O -
the O -
closest O -

must O -
have O -
had O -
difficulty O -
in O -
detecting O -
the O -

And O -
yet O -
all O -
this O -
might O -
have O -
been O -
endured O -

if O -
not O -
approved O -
, O -
by O -
the B-PER (5

But O -
the B-PER (38

gone O -
so O -

as O -

the O -

Mr. B-PER (1

the O -

Madame B-PER (6

A B-PER (22

Mr. B-PER (1

finally O -
lit O -
a O -
cigar O -

began O -
to O -
smoke O -
, O -
letting O -
the O -
paper O -
drag O -
idly O -
from O -
his O -

He O -
fixed O -
his O -
gaze O -
upon O -
a O -

that O -
was O -
advancing O -
at O -
snail O -

He O -
could O -
see O -
it O -
plainly O -
between O -
the O -

trunks O -
of O -
the O -
water-oaks O -
and O -
across O -
the O -

The O -

looked O -
far O -
away O -
, O -
melting O -
hazily O -
into O -
the O -

of O -
the O -

The O -
sunshade O -
continued O -
to O -
approach O -
slowly O -

Beneath O -
its O -
pink-lined O -

were O -
his B-PER (25|(1)

Mrs. B-PER (25

When O -
they O -
reached O -
the O -

the B-PER (27

themselves O -
with O -
some O -

“ O -

” O -

exclaimed O -
Mr. B-PER (1

. O -

He O -
himself O -
had O -
taken O -
a O -
plunge O -
at O -
daylight O -

That O -

why O -
the O -

seemed O -
long O -
to O -
him O -
. O -

“ O -
You O -
are O -
burnt O -
beyond O -
recognition O -
, O -
” O -
he O -
added O -
, O -
looking O -
at O -
his B-PER (25|(1)

as O -
one O -
looks O -
at O -
a O -
valuable O -
piece O -

She O -
held O -
up O -
her O -

shapely O -

and O -
surveyed O -
them O -
critically O -
, O -
drawing O -
up O -
her O -
fawn O -

above O -
the O -
wrists O -
. O -

Looking O -
at O -
them O -
reminded O -
her O -
of O -
her O -
rings O -
, O -
which O -
she O -
had O -
given O -
to O -
her B-PER (1|(25)

She O -
silently O -
reached O -
out O -
to O -
him O -
, O -
and O -
he O -
, O -
understanding O -
, O -
took O -
the O -
rings O -
from O -
his O -

and O -
dropped O -
them O -
into O -
her O -
open O -
palm O -

She O -
slipped O -
them O -
upon O -
her O -
fingers O -
; O -
then O -
clasping O -
her O -
knees O -
, O -
she O -
looked O -
across O -
at O -
Robert B-PER (26)
and O -
began O -
to O -
laugh O -
. O -

The O -
rings O -
sparkled O -
upon O -
her O -
fingers O -
. O -

He O -
sent O -
back O -
an O -

“ O -
What O -

it O -
? O -
” O -

asked O -
Pontellier B-PER (1)

looking O -
lazily O -
and O -
amused O -
from O -
one B-PER (25)
to O -
the B-PER (26

It O -
was O -
some O -
utter O -
nonsense O -
; O -
some O -
adventure O -
out O -
there O -
in O -
the O -
water O -
, O -
and O -
they O -
both O -
tried O -
to O -
relate O -
it O -
at O -
once O -

It O -
did O -
not O -
seem O -
half O -
so O -
amusing O -

They O -
realized O -
this O -

and O -
so O -
did O -
Mr. B-PER (1

. O -

He O -
yawned O -
and O -
stretched O -
himself O -

Then O -
he O -
got O -
up O -
, O -
saying O -

had O -
half O -
a O -

she O -

He O -
accepted O -

” O -

his B-PER (25|(1)

called O -
after O -
him O -
. O -

He O -
halted O -
a O -
moment O -
and O -
shrugged O -
his O -
shoulders O -
. O -

He O -
felt O -
in O -
his O -

; O -
there O -
was O -
a O -
ten-dollar O -
bill O -
there O -
. O -

He O -
did O -
not O -
know O -
; O -
perhaps O -
he O -
would O -
return O -
for O -
the O -
early O -
dinner O -
and O -
perhaps O -
he O -
would O -
not O -
. O -

It O -
all O -
depended O -
upon O -
the O -
company O -
which O -
he O -
found O -
over O -
at O -
Klein B-PER (30)|(29

and O -
the O -

He O -
did O -
not O -

she O -
understood O -
it O -
, O -
and O -
laughed O -
, O -
nodding O -
good-by O -
to O -
him O -
. O -

Both B-PER (20
children I-PER 20)
wanted O -

their B-PER (1|(20)

when O -
they O -
saw O -
him O -

II O -
Mrs. B-PER (25
Pontellier O -
's O -
eyes O -
were O -
quick O -
and O -
bright O -
; O -
they O -
were O -
a O -
yellowish O -
brown O -
, O -
about O -
the O -
color O -
of O -
her O -
hair O -
. O -

She O -
had O -
a O -
way O -
of O -
turning O -
them O -
swiftly O -
upon O -
an O -
object O -
and O -
holding O -
them O -
there O -
as O -
if O -
lost O -
in O -
some O -
inward O -
maze O -
of O -
contemplation O -
or O -
thought O -
. O -

Her O -
eyebrows O -
were O -
a O -
shade O -
darker O -
than O -
her O -
hair O -
. O -

They O -
were O -
thick O -
and O -
almost O -
horizontal O -
, O -
emphasizing O -
the O -
depth O -
of O -
her O -
eyes O -
. O -

She O -
was O -
rather O -
handsome O -
than O -
beautiful O -
. O -

Her O -
face O -
was O -
captivating O -
by O -
reason O -
of O -
a O -
certain O -
frankness O -
of O -
expression O -
and O -
a O -
contradictory O -
subtle O -
play O -
of O -
features O -
. O -

Her O -
manner O -
was O -
engaging O -
. O -

Robert B-PER (26)
rolled O -
a O -
cigarette O -
. O -

He O -
smoked O -
cigarettes O -
because O -
he O -
could O -
not O -
afford O -
cigars O -
, O -
he O -
said O -
. O -

He O -
had O -
a O -
cigar O -
in O -
his O -
pocket O -
which O -
Mr. B-PER (1
Pontellier O -
had O -
presented O -
him O -
with O -
, O -
and O -
he O -
was O -
saving O -
it O -
for O -
his O -
after-dinner O -
smoke O -
. O -

This O -
seemed O -
quite O -
proper O -
and O -
natural O -
on O -
his O -
part O -
. O -

In O -
coloring O -
he O -
was O -
not O -
unlike O -
his B-PER (26|(26)
companion I-PER 26)
. O -

A O -
clean-shaved O -
face O -
made O -
the O -
resemblance O -
more O -
pronounced O -
than O -
it O -
would O -
otherwise O -
have O -
been O -
. O -

There O -
rested O -
no O -
shadow O -
of O -
care O -
upon O -
his O -
open O -
countenance O -
. O -

His O -
eyes O -
gathered O -
in O -
and O -
reflected O -
the O -
light O -
and O -
languor O -
of O -
the O -
summer O -
day O -
. O -

Mrs. B-PER (25
Pontellier O -
reached O -
over O -
for O -
a O -
palm-leaf O -
fan O -
that O -
lay O -
on O -
the O -
porch O -
and O -
began O -

Robert B-PER (26)
sent O -
between O -
his O -

about O -

He O -
was O -
very O -
young O -
, O -
and O -
did O -
not O -

Mrs. B-PER (25

talked O -
a O -
little O -
about O -
herself O -
for O -
the O -

reason O -

Each B-PER (32)

Robert B-PER (26)

in O -
the O -

where O -

He O -

to O -
Mexico O -
, O -
but O -
some O -

never O -

Meanwhile O -
he O -
held O -
on O -
to O -
his O -
modest O -
position O -
in O -
a O -
mercantile O -
house O -
in O -
New O -
Orleans O -
, O -
where O -
an O -
equal O -
familiarity O -
with O -
English O -

Spanish O -
gave O -
him O -
no O -
small O -
value O -
as O -
a B-PER (36

and O -

. O -

He O -
was O -
spending O -
his O -
summer O -

as O -
he O -
always O -
did O -
, O -
with O -
his B-PER (6|(26)

at O -

In O -

the O -

comfortable O -
existence O -
which O -
appeared O -
to O -
be O -
her O -

. O -

Mrs. B-PER (25

talked O -
about O -
her B-PER (42|(25)

She O -
read O -
a O -

from O -

Robert B-PER (26)

“ O -

CHAPTER O -
1 O -
. O -

A O -
Not O -
Unnatural O -
Enterprise O -
This O -
is O -
written O -
from O -
memory O -
, O -
unfortunately O -
. O -

If O -
I O -
could O -
have O -
brought O -
with O -
me O -
the O -
material O -
I O -
so O -
carefully O -
prepared O -
, O -
this O -
would O -
be O -
a O -
very O -
different O -
story O -
. O -

Whole O -
books O -
full O -
of O -
notes O -
, O -
carefully O -
copied O -
records O -
, O -
firsthand O -
descriptions O -
, O -
and O -
the O -
pictures O -
-- O -
that O -
’s O -
the O -
worst O -
loss O -
. O -

We O -
had O -
some O -
bird O -
’s O -
- O -
eyes O -
of O -
the O -
cities O -
and O -
parks O -
; O -
a O -
lot O -
of O -
lovely O -
views O -
of O -
streets O -
, O -
of O -
buildings O -
, O -
outside O -
and O -
in O -
, O -
and O -
some O -
of O -
those O -
gorgeous O -
gardens O -
, O -
and O -
, O -
most O -
important O -
of O -
all O -
, O -
of O -
the B-PER (7
women I-PER 7)
themselves O -
. O -

Nobody B-PER (8)
will O -
ever O -
believe O -
how O -
they O -
looked O -
. O -

Descriptions O -
are O -
n’t O -
any O -
good O -
when O -
it O -
comes O -
to O -
women B-PER (9)
, O -
and O -
I O -
never O -
was O -
good O -
at O -
descriptions O -
anyhow O -
. O -

But O -
it O -
’s O -
got O -
to O -
be O -
done O -
somehow O -
; O -
the O -
rest O -
of O -
the O -
world O -
needs O -
to O -
know O -
about O -
that O -
country O -
. O -

I O -
have O -
n’t O -
said O -
where O -
it O -
was O -
for O -
fear O -
some B-PER (12
self-appointed I-PER -
missionaries I-PER 12)
, O -
or O -
traders B-PER (13)
, O -
or O -
land-greedy B-PER (14
expansionists I-PER 14)
, O -
will O -
take O -
it O -
upon O -
themselves O -
to O -
push O -
in O -
. O -

They O -
will O -
not O -
be O -
wanted O -
, O -
I O -
can O -
tell O -
them O -
that O -
, O -
and O -
will O -
fare O -
worse O -
than O -
we O -
did O -
if O -
they O -
do O -
find O -
it O -
. O -

It O -
began O -
this O -
way O -
. O -

There O -
were O -
three O -
of O -
us O -
, O -
classmates B-PER (98)
and O -
friends B-PER (96)
-- O -
Terry B-PER (16
O. I-PER -
Nicholson I-PER 16)
( O -
we O -
used O -
to O -
call O -
him O -
the O -
Old B-PER (16

, O -
with O -
good O -
reason O -
) O -

Jeff B-PER (18
Margrave I-PER 18)
, O -
and O -
I O -
, O -
Vandyck B-PER (99
Jennings I-PER 99)
. O -

We O -
had O -
known O -
each O -
other O -
years O -
and O -
years O -
, O -
and O -
in O -
spite O -
of O -
our O -
differences O -
we O -
had O -
a O -
good O -
deal O -
in O -
common O -
. O -

All O -
of O -
us O -
were O -
interested O -
in O -
science O -
. O -

Terry B-PER (16)
was O -
rich O -
enough O -
to O -
do O -
as O -
he O -
pleased O -
. O -

His O -
great O -
aim O -
was O -
exploration O -
. O -

He O -
used O -
to O -
make O -
all O -
kinds O -
of O -
a O -
row O -
because O -
there O -
was O -
nothing O -
left O -
to O -
explore O -
now O -
, O -
only O -
patchwork O -
and O -
filling O -
in O -
, O -
he O -
said O -
. O -

He O -
filled O -
in O -
well O -
enough O -
-- O -
he O -
had O -
a O -
lot O -
of O -
talents O -
-- O -
great O -
on O -
mechanics O -
and O -
electricity O -
. O -

Had O -
all O -
kinds O -
of O -
boats O -
and O -
motorcars O -
, O -
and O -
was O -
one O -
of O -
the O -
best O -
of O -
our B-PER (22|(23)

We O -
never O -
could O -
have O -
done O -
the O -
thing O -
at O -
all O -
without O -
Terry B-PER (16)

Jeff B-PER (18
Margrave I-PER 18)
was O -
born O -
to O -
be O -
a B-PER (24
poet I-PER 24)
, O -
a B-PER (25
botanist I-PER 25)
-- O -
or O -
both O -
-- O -
but O -
his B-PER (26|(18)
folks I-PER 26)
persuaded O -
him O -
to O -
be O -
a B-PER (100
doctor I-PER 100)
instead O -
. O -

He O -
was O -
a O -
good O -
one O -
, O -
for O -
his O -
age O -
, O -
but O -
his O -
real O -
interest O -
was O -
in O -
what O -
he O -
loved O -
to O -
call O -
“ O -
the O -
wonders O -
of O -
science O -
. O -
” O -

As O -
for O -
me O -
, O -
sociology O -
’s O -
my O -
major O -
. O -

You O -
have O -
to O -
back O -
that O -
up O -
with O -
a O -
lot O -
of O -
other O -
sciences O -
, O -
of O -
course O -
. O -

I O -
’m O -
interested O -
in O -
them O -
all O -
. O -

Terry B-PER (16)
was O -
strong O -
on O -
facts O -
-- O -
geography O -
and O -
meteorology O -
and O -
those O -
; O -
Jeff B-PER (18)
could O -
beat O -
him O -
any O -
time O -
on O -
biology O -
, O -
and O -
I O -
did O -
n’t O -
care O -
what O -
it O -
was O -
they O -
talked O -
about O -
, O -
so O -
long O -
as O -
it O -
connected O -
with O -
human O -
life O -
, O -
somehow O -
. O -

There O -
are O -
few O -
things O -
that O -
do O -
n’t O -
. O -

We O -
three O -
had O -
a O -
chance O -
to O -
join O -
a O -
big O -
scientific O -
expedition O -
. O -

They O -
needed O -
a B-PER (30
doctor I-PER 30)
, O -
and O -
that O -
gave O -
Jeff B-PER (18)
an O -
excuse O -
for O -
dropping O -
his O -
just O -
opening O -
practice O -
; O -
they O -
needed O -
Terry B-PER (16)
’s O -
experience O -
, O -
his O -
machine O -
, O -
and O -
his O -
money O -
; O -
and O -
as O -
for O -
me O -
, O -
I O -
got O -
in O -
through O -
Terry B-PER (16)
’s O -
influence O -
. O -

The O -
expedition O -
was O -
up O -
among O -
the O -
thousand O -
tributaries O -
and O -
enormous O -
hinterland O -
of O -
a O -
great O -
river O -
, O -
up O -
where O -
the O -
maps O -
had O -
to O -
be O -
made O -
, O -
savage O -
dialects O -
studied O -
, O -
and O -
all O -
manner O -
of O -
strange O -
flora O -
and O -
fauna O -
expected O -
. O -

But O -
this O -
story O -
is O -
not O -
about O -
that O -
expedition O -
. O -

That O -
was O -
only O -
the O -
merest O -
starter O -
for O -
ours O -
. O -

My O -
interest O -
was O -
first O -
roused O -
by O -
talk O -
among O -
our B-PER (33|(1)
guides I-PER 33)
. O -

I O -
’m O -
quick O -
at O -
languages O -
, O -
know O -
a O -
good O -
many O -
, O -
and O -
pick O -
them O -
up O -
readily O -
. O -

What O -
with O -
that O -
and O -
a B-PER (34
really I-PER -
good I-PER -
interpreter I-PER -
we I-PER (1)
took I-PER -
with I-PER -
us I-PER 34)|(1)
, O -
I O -
made O -
out O -
quite O -
a O -
few O -
legends O -
and O -
folk O -
myths O -
of O -
these B-PER (35
scattered I-PER -
tribes I-PER 35)
. O -

And O -
as O -
we O -
got O -
farther O -
and O -
farther O -
upstream O -
, O -
in O -
a O -
dark O -
tangle O -
of O -
rivers O -
, O -
lakes O -
, O -
morasses O -
, O -
and O -
dense O -
forests O -
, O -
with O -
here O -
and O -
there O -
an O -
unexpected O -
long O -
spur O -
running O -
out O -
from O -
the O -
big O -
mountains O -
beyond O -
, O -
I O -
noticed O -
that O -
more O -
and O -
more O -
of O -
these B-PER (42
savages I-PER 42)
had O -
a O -
story O -
about O -
a O -
strange O -
and O -
terrible O -
Woman O -
Land O -
in O -
the O -
high O -
distance O -
. O -

“ O -
Up O -
yonder O -
, O -
” O -
“ O -
Over O -
there O -
, O -
” O -
“ O -
Way O -
up O -
” O -
-- O -
was O -
all O -
the O -
direction O -
they O -
could O -
offer O -
, O -
but O -
their O -
legends O -
all O -
agreed O -
on O -
the O -
main O -
point O -
-- O -
that O -
there O -
was O -
this O -
strange O -
country O -
where O -
no O -
men B-PER 91)
lived O -
-- O -
only O -
women B-PER (43)
and O -
girl B-PER (44
children I-PER 44)
. O -

None O -
of O -
them O -
had O -
ever O -
seen O -
it O -
. O -

It O -
was O -
dangerous O -
, O -
deadly O -
, O -
they O -
said O -
, O -
for O -
any B-PER (45
man I-PER 45)
to O -
go O -
there O -
. O -

But O -
there O -
were O -
tales O -
of O -
long O -
ago O -
, O -
when O -
some B-PER (46
brave I-PER -
investigator I-PER 46)
had O -
seen O -
it O -
-- O -
a O -
Big O -
Country O -
, O -
Big O -
Houses O -
, O -
Plenty B-PER (48
People I-PER 48)
-- O -
All B-PER (49
Women I-PER 49)
. O -

Had O -
no B-PER (50
one I-PER -
else I-PER 50)
gone O -
? O -

Yes O -
-- O -
a O -
good O -
many O -
-- O -
but O -
they O -
never O -
came O -
back O -
. O -

It O -
was O -
no O -
place O -
for O -
men B-PER (52)
-- O -
of O -
that O -
they O -
seemed O -
sure O -
. O -

I O -
told O -
the B-PER (28
boys I-PER 28)
about O -
these O -
stories O -
, O -
and O -
they O -
laughed O -
at O -
them O -
. O -

Naturally O -
I O -
did O -
myself O -
. O -

I O -
knew O -
the O -
stuff O -
that O -
savage O -
dreams O -
are O -
made O -
of O -
. O -

But O -
when O -
we O -
had O -
reached O -
our O -
farthest O -
point O -
, O -
just O -
the O -
day O -
before O -
we O -
all O -
had O -
to O -
turn O -
around O -
and O -
start O -
for O -
home O -
again O -
, O -
as O -
the O -
best O -
of O -
expeditions O -
must O -
in O -
time O -
, O -
we O -
three O -
made O -
a O -
discovery O -
. O -

The O -
main O -
encampment O -
was O -
on O -
a O -
spit O -
of O -
land O -
running O -
out O -
into O -
the O -
main O -
stream O -
, O -
or O -
what O -
we O -
thought O -
was O -
the O -
main O -
stream O -
. O -

It O -
had O -
the O -
same O -
muddy O -
color O -
we O -
had O -
been O -
seeing O -
for O -
weeks O -
past O -
, O -
the O -
same O -
taste O -
. O -

I O -
happened O -
to O -
speak O -
of O -
that O -
river O -
to O -
our B-PER (57|(1)
last I-PER -
guide I-PER 57)
, O -
a B-PER (97
rather I-PER -
superior I-PER -
fellow I-PER -
with I-PER -
quick I-PER -
, I-PER -
bright I-PER -
eyes I-PER 97)
. O -

He O -
told O -
me O -
that O -
there O -
was O -
another O -
river O -
-- O -
“ O -
over O -
there O -
, O -
short O -
river O -
, O -
sweet O -
water O -
, O -
red O -
and O -
blue O -
. O -
” O -

I O -
was O -
interested O -
in O -
this O -
and O -
anxious O -
to O -
see O -
if O -
I O -
had O -
understood O -
, O -
so O -
I O -
showed O -
him O -
a O -
red O -
and O -
blue O -
pencil O -
I O -
carried O -
, O -
and O -
asked O -
again O -
. O -

Yes O -
, O -
he O -
pointed O -
to O -
the O -
river O -
, O -
and O -
then O -
to O -
the O -
southwestward O -
. O -

“ O -
River O -
-- O -
good O -
water O -
-- O -
red O -
and O -
blue O -
. O -
” O -

Terry B-PER (16)
was O -
close O -
by O -
and O -
interested O -
in O -
the B-PER (57
fellow I-PER 57)
’s O -
pointing O -
. O -

“ O -
What O -
does O -
he O -
say O -
, O -
Van B-PER (0)
? O -
” O -

I O -
told O -
him O -
. O -

Terry B-PER (16)
blazed O -
up O -
at O -
once O -
. O -

“ O -
Ask O -
him O -
how O -
far O -
it O -
is O -
. O -
” O -

The B-PER (57
man I-PER 57)
indicated O -
a O -
short O -
journey O -
; O -
I O -
judged O -
about O -
two O -
hours O -
, O -
maybe O -
three O -
. O -

“ O -
Let O -
’s O -
go O -
, O -
” O -
urged O -
Terry B-PER (16)
. O -

“ O -
Just O -
us O -
three O -
. O -

Maybe O -
we O -
can O -
really O -
find O -
something O -
. O -

May O -
be O -
cinnabar O -
in O -
it O -
. O -
” O -

“ O -
May O -
be O -
indigo O -
, O -
” O -
Jeff B-PER (18)
suggested O -
, O -
with O -
his O -
lazy O -
smile O -
. O -

It O -
was O -
early O -
yet O -
; O -
we O -
had O -
just O -
breakfasted O -
; O -
and O -
leaving O -
word O -
that O -
we O -
’d O -
be O -
back O -
before O -
night O -
, O -
we O -
got O -
away O -
quietly O -
, O -
not O -
wishing O -
to O -
be O -
thought O -
too O -
gullible O -
if O -
we O -
failed O -
, O -
and O -
secretly O -
hoping O -
to O -
have O -
some O -
nice O -
little O -
discovery O -
all O -
to O -
ourselves O -
. O -

It O -
was O -
a O -
long O -
two O -
hours O -
, O -
nearer O -
three O -
. O -

I O -
fancy O -
the B-PER (57
savage I-PER 57)
could O -
have O -
done O -
it O -
alone O -
much O -
quicker O -
. O -

There O -
was O -
a O -
desperate O -
tangle O -
of O -
wood O -
and O -
water O -
and O -
a O -
swampy O -
patch O -
we O -
never O -
should O -
have O -
found O -
our O -
way O -
across O -
alone O -
. O -

But O -
there O -
was O -
one O -
, O -
and O -
I O -
could O -
see O -
Terry B-PER (16)
, O -
with O -
compass O -
and O -
notebook O -
, O -
marking O -
directions O -
and O -
trying O -
to O -
place O -
landmarks O -
. O -

We O -
came O -
after O -
a O -
while O -
to O -
a O -
sort O -
of O -
marshy O -
lake O -
, O -
very O -
big O -
, O -
so O -
that O -
the O -
circling O -
forest O -
looked O -
quite O -
low O -
and O -
dim O -
across O -
it O -
. O -

Our B-PER (57|(1)
guide I-PER 57)
told O -
us O -
that O -
boats O -
could O -
go O -
from O -
there O -
to O -
our O -
camp O -
-- O -
but O -
“ O -
long O -
way O -
-- O -
all O -
day O -
. O -
” O -

This O -
water O -
was O -
somewhat O -
clearer O -
than O -
that O -
we O -
had O -
left O -
, O -
but O -
we O -
could O -
not O -
judge O -
well O -
from O -
the O -
margin O -
. O -

We O -
skirted O -
it O -
for O -
another O -
half O -
hour O -
or O -
so O -
, O -
the O -
ground O -
growing O -
firmer O -
as O -
we O -
advanced O -
, O -
and O -
presently O -
we O -
turned O -
the O -
corner O -
of O -
a O -
wooded O -
promontory O -
and O -
saw O -
a O -
quite O -
different O -
country O -
-- O -
a O -
sudden O -
view O -
of O -
mountains O -
, O -
steep O -
and O -
bare O -
. O -

“ O -
One O -
of O -
those O -
long O -
easterly O -
spurs O -
, O -
” O -
Terry B-PER (16)
said O -
appraisingly O -
. O -

“ O -
May O -
be O -
hundreds O -
of O -
miles O -
from O -
the O -
range O -
. O -

They O -
crop O -
out O -
like O -
that O -
. O -
” O -

Suddenly O -
we O -
left O -
the O -
lake O -
and O -
struck O -
directly O -
toward O -
the O -
cliffs O -
. O -

We O -
heard O -
running O -
water O -
before O -
we O -
reached O -
it O -
, O -
and O -
the B-PER (57
guide I-PER 57)
pointed O -
proudly O -
to O -
his O -
river O -
. O -

It O -
was O -
short O -
. O -

We O -
could O -
see O -
where O -
it O -
poured O -
down O -
a O -
narrow O -
vertical O -
cataract O -
from O -
an O -
opening O -

“ O -

“ O -

But O -
as O -

it O -
was O -

The B-PER (57

seemed O -
not O -

all O -
surprised O -
. O -

He O -
hunted O -
about O -
a O -
little O -

showed O -
us O -
a O -
quiet O -
marginal O -

there O -
were O -

; O -
yes O -
, O -
and O -
of O -
blue O -

Terry B-PER (16)
got O -
out O -
his O -
magnifying O -
glass O -
and O -
squatted O -
down O -
to O -
investigate O -

“ O -

he O -
urged O -

“ O -

We O -
scrambled O -
along O -
the O -

and O -
got O -
close O -
to O -
the O -
pool O -
that O -
foamed O -
and O -
boiled O -
beneath O -
the O -
falling O -
water O -
. O -

Here O -
we O -
searched O -
the O -

and O -
found O -
traces O -
of O -
color O -
beyond O -

More O -
-- O -
Jeff O -
suddenly O -
held O -
up O -
an O -
unlooked-for O -
trophy O -
. O -

It O -
was O -
only O -
a O -
rag O -
, O -
a O -
long O -
, O -
raveled O -
fragment O -
of O -

But O -
it O -
was O -
a O -
well-woven O -
fabric O -
, O -
with O -
a O -
pattern O -
, O -
and O -
of O -
a O -
clear O -

not O -

No O -

that O -
we O -
had O -
heard O -

such O -

The B-PER (57

stood O -
serenely O -
on O -
the O -
bank O -
, O -
well O -
pleased O -
with O -

“ O -

we O -

right O -
there O -
and O -
pumped O -
the B-PER (57

looked O -

But O -
the B-PER (57

would O -
not O -

up O -

might O -
almost O -
seem O -
the O -

But O -
the O -

would O -
include O -

-- O -
we O -
shall O -
commence O -
the O -
real O -
action O -
of O -
our O -
tale O -
at O -
an O -
epoch O -
not O -
very O -
remote O -
from O -
the O -
present O -
day O -

Still O -
, O -
there O -
will O -
be O -
a O -
connection O -
with O -
the O -
long O -

a O -
reference O -
to O -

obsolete O -

which O -
, O -
if O -
adequately O -

might O -
be O -
drawn O -
a O -
weighty O -

the O -

Without O -

I O -
am O -

how O -

I O -
do O -
not O -

Possibly O -
I O -
am O -
a O -
hundred O -
, O -
possibly O -
more O -
; O -
but O -
I O -
can O -
not O -
tell O -
because O -
I O -
have O -
never O -
aged O -
as O -
other B-PER (3
men I-PER 3)
, O -
nor O -
do O -
I O -
remember O -
any O -

. O -

So O -
far O -
as O -
I O -
can O -
recollect O -
I O -
have O -
always O -
been O -
a B-PER (65

a B-PER (61

I O -
appear O -
today O -
as O -
I O -
did O -
forty O -
years O -
and O -
more O -
ago O -
, O -
and O -
yet O -
I O -
feel O -
that O -
I O -
can O -
not O -
go O -
on O -
living O -
forever O -
; O -
that O -
some O -
day O -
I O -
shall O -
die O -
the O -
real O -
death O -
from O -
which O -
there O -
is O -
no O -
resurrection O -

I O -
do O -
not O -
know O -
why O -
I O -
should O -
fear O -
death O -
, O -
I O -
who O -
have O -
died O -
twice O -
and O -
am O -
still O -
alive O -
; O -
but O -
yet O -
I O -
have O -
the O -
same O -
horror O -
of O -
it O -
as O -
you O -
who O -
have O -
never O -
died O -
, O -
and O -
it O -
is O -
because O -
of O -
this O -
terror O -
of O -
death O -
, O -
I O -
believe O -
, O -
that O -
I O -
am O -
so O -
convinced O -
of O -
my O -
mortality O -

And O -
because O -
of O -
this O -
conviction O -
I O -
have O -
determined O -
to O -
write O -
down O -

I O -
can O -
not O -

that O -
my B-PER (2|(2)

undiscovered O -

I O -
have O -
never O -

I O -
know O -
that O -

I O -
spent O -
nearly O -
a O -

with O -
another B-PER (19

We O -
were O -
extremely O -
fortunate O -
, O -
for O -
late O -
in O -
the O -
winter O -
of O -
1865 O -
, O -
after O -
many O -
hardships O -
and O -
privations O -
, O -
we O -
located O -
the O -
most O -
remarkable O -
gold-bearing O -
quartz O -
vein O -
that O -
our O -
wildest O -
dreams O -
had O -
ever O -
pictured O -
. O -

Powell B-PER (19)
, O -
who O -
was O -
a B-PER (19
mining I-PER -
engineer I-PER -
by I-PER -
education I-PER 19)
, O -
stated O -
that O -
we O -
had O -
uncovered O -
over O -
a O -
million O -
dollars O -
worth O -
of O -
ore O -
in O -
a O -
trifle O -
over O -
three O -
months O -
. O -

As O -
our O -
equipment O -
was O -
crude O -
in O -
the O -
extreme O -
we O -
decided O -
that O -
one O -
of O -
us O -
must O -
return O -
to O -
civilization O -
, O -
purchase O -
the O -
necessary O -
machinery O -
and O -
return O -
with O -
a O -
sufficient O -
force O -
of O -
men B-PER (24)|23)
properly O -
to O -
work O -
the O -
mine O -
. O -

As O -
Powell B-PER (19)
was O -
familiar O -
with O -
the O -
country O -
, O -
as O -
well O -
as O -
with O -
the O -
mechanical O -
requirements O -
of O -
mining O -
we O -
determined O -
that O -
it O -
would O -
be O -
best O -
for O -
him O -
to O -
make O -
the O -
trip O -
. O -

It O -
was O -
agreed O -
that O -
I O -
was O -
to O -
hold O -
down O -
our O -
claim O -
against O -
the O -
remote O -
possibility O -
of O -
its O -
being O -
jumped O -
by O -
some B-PER (27
wandering I-PER -
prospector I-PER 27)
. O -

On O -
March O -
3 O -
, O -
1866 O -
, O -
Powell B-PER (19)
and O -
I O -
packed O -
his O -
provisions O -
on O -
two O -
of O -
our O -
burros O -
, O -
and O -
bidding O -
me O -
good-bye O -
he O -
mounted O -
his O -
horse O -
, O -
and O -
started O -
down O -
the O -
mountainside O -
toward O -
the O -
valley O -
, O -
across O -
which O -
led O -
the O -
first O -
stage O -
of O -
his O -
journey O -
. O -

The O -
morning O -
of O -
Powell B-PER (19)
's O -
departure O -
was O -
, O -
like O -
nearly O -
all O -
Arizona O -
mornings O -
, O -
clear O -
and O -
beautiful O -
; O -
I O -
could O -
see O -
him O -
and O -
his O -
little O -
pack O -
animals O -
picking O -
their O -
way O -
down O -
the O -
mountainside O -
toward O -
the O -
valley O -
, O -
and O -
all O -
during O -
the O -
morning O -
I O -
would O -
catch O -
occasional O -
glimpses O -
of O -
them O -
as O -
they O -
topped O -
a O -
hog O -
back O -
or O -
came O -
out O -
upon O -
a O -
level O -
plateau O -
. O -

My O -
last O -
sight O -
of O -
Powell B-PER (19)
was O -
about O -
three O -
in O -
the O -
afternoon O -
as O -
he O -
entered O -
the O -
shadows O -
of O -
the O -
range O -
on O -
the O -
opposite O -
side O -
of O -
the O -
valley O -
. O -

Some O -
half O -
hour O -
later O -
I O -
happened O -
to O -
glance O -
casually O -
across O -
the O -
valley O -
and O -
was O -
much O -
surprised O -
to O -
note O -
three O -
little O -
dots O -
in O -
about O -
the O -
same O -
place O -
I O -
had O -
last O -
seen O -
my B-PER (19|(2)
friend I-PER 19)
and O -
his O -
two O -
pack O -
animals O -
. O -

I O -
am O -
not O -
given O -
to O -
needless O -
worrying O -
, O -
but O -
the O -
more O -
I O -
tried O -
to O -
convince O -
myself O -
that O -
all O -
was O -
well O -
with O -
Powell B-PER (19)
, O -
and O -
that O -
the O -
dots O -
I O -
had O -
seen O -
on O -
his O -
trail O -
were O -
antelope O -
or O -
wild O -
horses O -
, O -
the O -
less O -
I O -
was O -
able O -
to O -
assure O -
myself O -
. O -

Since O -
we O -
had O -
entered O -
the B-PER (32
territory I-PER 32)
we O -
had O -
not O -
seen O -
a B-PER (33
hostile I-PER -
Indian I-PER 33)
, O -
and O -
we O -
had O -
, O -
therefore O -
, O -
become O -
careless O -
in O -
the O -
extreme O -
, O -
and O -
were O -
wont O -
to O -
ridicule O -
the O -
stories O -
we O -
had O -
heard O -
of O -
the O -
great O -
numbers O -
of O -
these O -
vicious O -
marauders O -
that O -
were O -
supposed O -
to O -
haunt O -
the O -
trails O -
, O -
taking O -
their O -
toll O -
in O -
lives O -
and O -
torture O -
of O -
every B-PER (35
white I-PER -
party I-PER -
which I-PER -
fell I-PER -
into I-PER -
their I-PER (34)
merciless I-PER -
clutches I-PER 34)|35)
. O -

Powell B-PER (19)
, O -
I O -
knew O -
, O -
was O -
well O -
armed O -
and O -
, O -
further O -
, O -
an O -
experienced O -
Indian B-PER (36)
fighter O -
; O -
but O -
I O -
too O -
had O -
lived O -
and O -
fought O -
for O -
years O -
among O -
the O -
Sioux O -
in O -
the O -
North O -
, O -
and O -
I O -
knew O -
that O -
his O -
chances O -
were O -
small O -
against O -
a O -
party O -
of O -
cunning B-PER (40
trailing I-PER -
Apaches I-PER 40)|39)
. O -

Finally O -
I O -
could O -
endure O -
the O -
suspense O -
no O -
longer O -
, O -
and O -
, O -
arming O -
myself O -
with O -
my O -
two O -
Colt O -
revolvers O -
and O -
a O -
carbine O -
, O -
I O -
strapped O -
two O -
belts O -
of O -
cartridges O -
about O -
me O -
and O -
catching O -
my O -
saddle O -
horse O -
, O -
started O -
down O -
the O -
trail O -
taken O -
by O -
Powell B-PER (19)
in O -
the O -
morning O -
. O -

As O -
soon O -
as O -
I O -
reached O -
comparatively O -
level O -
ground O -
I O -
urged O -
my O -
mount O -
into O -
a O -
canter O -
and O -
continued O -
this O -
, O -
where O -
the O -
going O -
permitted O -
, O -
until O -
, O -
close O -
upon O -
dusk O -
, O -
I O -
discovered O -
the O -
point O -
where O -
other O -
tracks O -
joined O -
those O -
of O -
Powell B-PER (19)
. O -

They O -
were O -
the O -
tracks O -
of O -
unshod O -
ponies O -
, O -
three O -
of O -
them O -
, O -
and O -
the O -
ponies O -
had O -
been O -
galloping O -
. O -

I O -
followed O -
rapidly O -
until O -
, O -
darkness O -
shutting O -
down O -
, O -
I O -
was O -
forced O -
to O -
await O -
the O -
rising O -
of O -
the O -
moon O -
, O -
and O -
given O -
an O -
opportunity O -
to O -
speculate O -
on O -
the O -
question O -
of O -
the O -
wisdom O -
of O -
my O -
chase O -
. O -

Possibly O -
I O -
had O -
conjured O -
up O -
impossible O -
dangers O -
, O -
like O -
some B-PER (42
nervous I-PER -
old I-PER -
housewife I-PER 42)
, O -
and O -
when O -
I O -
should O -
catch O -
up O -
with O -
Powell B-PER (19)
would O -
get O -
a O -
good O -
laugh O -
for O -
my O -
pains O -
. O -

However O -
, O -
I O -
am O -
not O -
prone O -
to O -
sensitiveness O -
, O -
and O -
the O -
following O -
of O -
a O -
sense O -
of O -
duty O -
, O -
wherever O -
it O -
may O -
lead O -
, O -
has O -
always O -
been O -
a O -
kind O -
of O -
fetich O -
with O -
me O -
throughout O -
my O -
life O -
; O -
which O -
may O -
account O -
for O -
the O -
honors O -
bestowed O -
upon O -
me O -
by O -
three O -
republics O -
and O -
the O -
decorations O -
and O -
friendships O -
of O -
an B-PER (43
old I-PER -
and I-PER -
powerful I-PER -
emperor I-PER 43)
and O -
several B-PER (44
lesser I-PER -
kings I-PER -
, I-PER -
in I-PER -
whose I-PER -
service I-PER -
my I-PER (2)
sword I-PER -
has I-PER -
been I-PER -
red I-PER -
many I-PER -
a I-PER -
time I-PER 44)
. O -

About O -
nine O -
o'clock O -
the O -
moon O -
was O -
sufficiently O -
bright O -
for O -
me O -
to O -
proceed O -
on O -
my O -
way O -
and O -
I O -
had O -
no O -
difficulty O -
in O -
following O -
the O -
trail O -
at O -
a O -
fast O -
walk O -
, O -
and O -
in O -
some O -
places O -
at O -
a O -
brisk O -
trot O -
until O -
, O -
about O -
midnight O -
, O -
I O -
reached O -
the O -
water O -
hole O -
where O -
Powell B-PER (19)
had O -
expected O -
to O -
camp O -
. O -

I O -
came O -
upon O -
the O -
spot O -
unexpectedly O -
, O -
finding O -
it O -
entirely O -
deserted O -
, O -
with O -
no O -
signs O -
of O -
having O -
been O -
recently O -
occupied O -
as O -
a O -
camp O -
. O -

I O -
was O -
interested O -
to O -
note O -
that O -
the O -
tracks O -
of O -
the B-PER (46
pursuing I-PER -
horsemen I-PER -
, I-PER -
for I-PER -
such I-PER -
I I-PER (2)
was I-PER -
now I-PER -
convinced I-PER -
they I-PER -
must I-PER -
be I-PER 46)
, O -
continued O -
after O -
Powell B-PER (19)
with O -
only O -
a O -
brief O -
stop O -
at O -
the O -
hole O -
for O -
water O -
; O -
and O -
always O -
at O -
the O -
same O -
rate O -
of O -
speed O -
as O -
his O -
. O -

I O -
was O -
positive O -
now O -
that O -
the B-PER (46
trailers I-PER 46)
were O -
Apaches B-PER (66)
and O -
that O -
they O -
wished O -
to O -
capture O -
Powell B-PER (19)
alive O -
for O -
the O -
fiendish O -
pleasure O -
of O -
the O -
torture O -
, O -
so O -
I O -
urged O -
my O -
horse O -
onward O -
at O -
a O -
most O -
dangerous O -
pace O -
, O -
hoping O -
against O -
hope O -
that O -
I O -
would O -
catch O -
up O -
with O -
the B-PER (46
red I-PER -
rascals I-PER 46)
before O -
they O -
attacked O -
him O -
. O -

Further O -
speculation O -
was O -
suddenly O -
cut O -
short O -
by O -
the O -
faint O -
report O -
of O -
two O -
shots O -
far O -
ahead O -
of O -
me O -
. O -

I O -
knew O -
that O -
Powell B-PER (19)
would O -
need O -
me O -
now O -
if O -
ever O -
, O -
and O -
I O -
instantly O -
urged O -
my O -
horse O -
to O -
his O -
topmost O -
speed O -
up O -
the O -
narrow O -
and O -
difficult O -
mountain O -
trail O -
. O -

I O -
had O -
forged O -
ahead O -
for O -
perhaps O -
a O -
mile O -
or O -
more O -
without O -
hearing O -
further O -
sounds O -
, O -
when O -
the O -
trail O -
suddenly O -
debouched O -
onto O -
a O -
small O -
, O -
open O -
plateau O -
near O -
the O -
summit O -
of O -
the O -
pass O -
. O -

I O -
had O -
passed O -
through O -
a O -
narrow O -
, O -
overhanging O -
gorge O -
just O -
before O -
entering O -
suddenly O -
upon O -
this O -
table O -
land O -
, O -
and O -
the O -
sight O -
which O -
met O -
my O -
eyes O -
filled O -
me O -
with O -
consternation O -
and O -
dismay O -
. O -

The O -
little O -
stretch O -
of O -
level O -
land O -
was O -
white O -
with O -
Indian O -
tepees O -
, O -
and O -
there O -
were O -
probably O -
half B-PER (53
a I-PER -
thousand I-PER -
red I-PER -
warriors I-PER 53)
clustered O -
around O -
some O -
object O -
near O -
the O -
center O -
of O -
the O -
camp O -
. O -

Their O -
attention O -
was O -
so O -
wholly O -
riveted O -
to O -
this O -
point O -
of O -
interest O -
that O -
they O -
did O -
not O -
notice O -
me O -
, O -
and O -
I O -
easily O -
could O -
have O -
turned O -
back O -
into O -
the O -
dark O -
recesses O -
of O -
the O -
gorge O -
and O -
made O -
my O -
escape O -
with O -
perfect O -
safety O -
. O -

The O -
fact O -
, O -
however O -
, O -
that O -
this O -
thought O -
did O -
not O -
occur O -
to O -
me O -
until O -
the O -
following O -
day O -
removes O -
any O -
possible O -
right O -
to O -
a O -
claim O -
to O -
heroism O -
to O -
which O -
the O -
narration O -
of O -
this O -
episode O -
might O -
possibly O -
otherwise O -
entitle O -
me O -
. O -

I O -
do O -
not O -
believe O -
that O -
I O -
am O -
made O -
of O -
the O -
stuff O -
which O -
constitutes O -
heroes B-PER (56)
, O -
because O -
, O -
in O -
all O -
of O -
the O -
hundreds O -
of O -
instances O -
that O -
my O -
voluntary O -
acts O -
have O -
placed O -
me O -
face O -
to O -
face O -
with O -
death O -
, O -
I O -
can O -
not O -
recall O -
a O -
single O -
one O -
where O -
any O -
alternative O -
step O -
to O -
that O -
I O -
took O -
occurred O -
to O -
me O -
until O -
many O -
hours O -
later O -
. O -

My O -
mind O -
is O -
evidently O -
so O -
constituted O -
that O -
I O -
am O -
subconsciously O -
forced O -
into O -
the O -
path O -
of O -
duty O -
without O -
recourse O -
to O -
tiresome O -
mental O -
processes O -
. O -

However O -
that O -
may O -
be O -
, O -
I O -
have O -
never O -
regretted O -
that O -
cowardice O -
is O -
not O -
optional O -
with O -
me O -
. O -

In O -
this O -
instance O -
I O -
was O -
, O -
of O -
course O -
, O -
positive O -
that O -
Powell B-PER (19)
was O -
the B-PER (67
center I-PER -
of I-PER -
attraction I-PER 67)
, O -
but O -
whether O -
I O -
thought O -
or O -
acted O -
first O -
I O -
do O -
not O -
know O -
, O -
but O -
within O -
an O -
instant O -
from O -
the O -
moment O -
the O -
scene O -
broke O -
upon O -
my O -
view O -
I O -
had O -
whipped O -
out O -
my O -
revolvers O -
and O -
was O -
charging O -
down O -
upon O -
the O -
entire O -
army O -
of O -
warriors B-PER 53)
, O -
shooting O -
rapidly O -
, O -
and O -
whooping O -
at O -
the O -
top O -
of O -
my O -
lungs O -
. O -

Singlehanded O -
, O -
I O -
could O -
not O -
have O -
pursued O -
better O -
tactics O -
, O -
for O -
the O -
red O -
men O -
, O -
convinced O -
by O -
sudden O -
surprise O -
that O -
not O -
less O -
than O -
a O -
regiment O -
of O -
regulars B-PER 57)
was O -
upon O -
them O -
, O -
turned O -
and O -
fled O -
in O -
every O -
direction O -
for O -
their O -
bows O -
, O -
arrows O -
, O -
and O -
rifles O -
. O -

The O -
view O -
which O -
their O -
hurried O -
routing O -
disclosed O -
filled O -
me O -
with O -
apprehension O -
and O -
with O -
rage O -
. O -

Under O -
the O -
clear O -
rays O -
of O -
the O -
Arizona O -
moon O -
lay O -
Powell B-PER (19)
, O -
his O -
body O -
fairly O -
bristling O -
with O -
the O -
hostile O -
arrows O -
of O -
the B-PER (53

. O -

That O -
he O -
was O -
already O -
dead O -
I O -
could O -
not O -
but O -
be O -
convinced O -
, O -
and O -
yet O -
I O -
would O -
have O -
saved O -
his B-PER (19|(19)

from O -

The B-PER (58

pointed O -

Herncastle B-PER (7)

His O -

grew O -

a O -

Familiarity O -
with O -

that O -

CHAPTER O -
I O -
I O -
MEET O -
SIR B-PER (1
HENRY I-PER -
CURTIS I-PER 1)
It O -
is O -
a O -
curious O -
thing O -
that O -
at O -
my O -
age O -
-- O -
fifty-five O -
last O -
birthday O -
-- O -
I O -
should O -
find O -
myself O -
taking O -
up O -
a O -
pen O -
to O -
try O -
to O -
write O -
a O -
history O -
. O -

I O -
wonder O -
what O -
sort O -
of O -
a O -
history O -
it O -
will O -
be O -
when O -
I O -
have O -
finished O -
it O -
, O -
if O -
ever O -
I O -
come O -
to O -
the O -
end O -
of O -
the O -
trip O -
! O -

I O -
have O -
done O -
a O -
good O -
many O -
things O -
in O -
my O -
life O -
, O -
which O -
seems O -
a O -
long O -
one O -
to O -
me O -
, O -
owing O -
to O -
my O -
having O -
begun O -
work O -
so O -
young O -
, O -
perhaps O -
. O -

At O -
an O -
age O -
when O -
other B-PER (2
boys I-PER 2)
are O -
at O -
school O -
I O -
was O -
earning O -
my O -
living O -
as O -
a O -
trader O -
in O -
the O -
old O -
Colony O -
. O -

I O -
have O -
been O -
trading O -
, O -
hunting O -
, O -
fighting O -
, O -
or O -
mining O -
ever O -
since O -
. O -

And O -
yet O -
it O -
is O -
only O -
eight O -
months O -
ago O -
that O -
I O -
made O -
my O -
pile O -
. O -

It O -
is O -
a O -
big O -
pile O -
now O -
that O -
I O -
have O -
got O -
it O -
-- O -
I O -
do O -
n't O -
yet O -
know O -
how O -
big O -
-- O -
but O -
I O -
do O -
not O -
think O -
I O -
would O -
go O -
through O -
the O -
last O -
fifteen O -
or O -
sixteen O -
months O -
again O -
for O -
it O -
; O -
no O -
, O -
not O -
if O -
I O -
knew O -
that O -
I O -
should O -
come O -
out O -
safe O -
at O -
the O -
end O -
, O -
pile O -
and O -
all O -
. O -

But O -
then O -
I O -
am O -
a B-PER (82
timid I-PER -
man I-PER 82)
, O -
and O -
dislike O -
violence O -
; O -
moreover O -
, O -
I O -
am O -
almost O -
sick O -
of O -
adventure O -
. O -

I O -
wonder O -
why O -
I O -
am O -
going O -
to O -
write O -
this O -
book O -
: O -
it O -
is O -
not O -
in O -
my O -
line O -
. O -

I O -
am O -
not O -
a B-PER (76
literary I-PER -
man I-PER 76)
, O -
though O -
very O -
devoted O -
to O -
the O -
Old O -
Testament O -
and O -
also O -
to O -
the O -
" O -
Ingoldsby O -
Legends O -
. O -
" O -

Let O -
me O -
try O -
to O -
set O -
down O -
my O -
reasons O -
, O -
just O -
to O -
see O -
if O -
I O -
have O -
any O -
. O -

First O -
reason O -
: O -
Because O -
Sir B-PER (1
Henry O -
Curtis O -
and O -
Captain B-PER (5
John O -
Good O -
asked O -
me O -
. O -

Second O -
reason O -
: O -
Because O -
I O -
am O -
laid O -
up O -
here O -
at O -
Durban O -
with O -
the O -
pain O -
in O -
my O -
left O -
leg O -
. O -

Ever O -
since O -
that O -
confounded O -
lion O -
got O -
hold O -
of O -
me O -
I O -
have O -
been O -
liable O -
to O -
this O -
trouble O -
, O -
and O -
being O -
rather O -
bad O -
just O -
now O -
, O -
it O -
makes O -
me O -
limp O -
more O -
than O -
ever O -
. O -

There O -
must O -
be O -
some O -
poison O -
in O -
a O -
lion O -
's O -
teeth O -
, O -
otherwise O -
how O -
is O -
it O -
that O -
when O -
your O -
wounds O -
are O -
healed O -
they O -
break O -
out O -
again O -
, O -
generally O -
, O -
mark O -
you O -
, O -
at O -
the O -
same O -
time O -
of O -
year O -
that O -
you O -
got O -
your O -
mauling O -
? O -

It O -
is O -
a O -
hard O -
thing O -
when O -
one O -
has O -
shot O -
sixty-five O -
lions O -
or O -
more O -
, O -
as O -
I O -
have O -
in O -
the O -
course O -
of O -
my O -
life O -
, O -
that O -
the O -
sixty-sixth O -
should O -
chew O -
your O -
leg O -
like O -
a O -
quid O -
of O -
tobacco O -
. O -

It O -
breaks O -
the O -
routine O -
of O -
the O -
thing O -
, O -
and O -
putting O -
other O -
considerations O -
aside O -
, O -
I O -
am O -
an B-PER (83
orderly I-PER -
man I-PER 83)
and O -
do O -
n't O -
like O -
that O -
. O -

This O -
is O -
by O -
the O -
way O -
. O -

Third O -
reason O -
: O -
Because O -
I O -
want O -
my B-PER (12|(0)
boy I-PER 12)
Harry O -
, O -
who O -
is O -
over O -
there O -
at O -
the O -
hospital O -
in O -
London O -
studying O -
to O -
become O -
a B-PER (15
doctor I-PER 15)|12)
, O -
to O -
have O -
something O -
to O -
amuse O -
him O -
and O -
keep O -
him O -
out O -
of O -
mischief O -
for O -
a O -
week O -
or O -
so O -
. O -

Hospital O -
work O -
must O -
sometimes O -
pall O -
and O -
grow O -
rather O -
dull O -
, O -
for O -
even O -
of O -
cutting O -
up O -
dead O -
bodies O -
there O -
may O -
come O -
satiety O -
, O -
and O -
as O -
this O -
history O -
will O -
not O -
be O -
dull O -
, O -
whatever O -
else O -
it O -
may O -
be O -
, O -
it O -
will O -
put O -
a O -
little O -
life O -
into O -
things O -
for O -
a O -
day O -
or O -
two O -
while O -
Harry B-PER (12)
is O -
reading O -
of O -
our O -
adventures O -
. O -

Fourth O -
reason O -
and O -
last O -
: O -
Because O -
I O -
am O -
going O -
to O -
tell O -
the O -
strangest O -
story O -
that O -
I O -
remember O -
. O -

It O -
may O -
seem O -
a O -
queer O -
thing O -
to O -
say O -
, O -
especially O -
considering O -
that O -
there O -
is O -
no B-PER (18
woman I-PER 18)
in O -
it O -
-- O -
except O -
Foulata B-PER (19)
. O -

Stop O -
, O -
though O -
! O -

there O -
is O -
Gagaoola B-PER (20)
, O -
if O -
she O -
was O -
a B-PER (78
woman I-PER 78)
, O -
and O -
not O -
a B-PER (77
fiend I-PER 77)
. O -

But O -
she O -
was O -
a O -
hundred O -
at O -
least O -
, O -
and O -
therefore O -
not O -
marriageable O -
, O -
so O -
I O -
do O -
n't O -
count O -
her O -
. O -

At O -
any O -
rate O -
, O -
I O -
can O -
safely O -
say O -
that O -
there O -
is O -
not O -
a O -
_ O -
petticoat O -
_ O -
in O -
the O -
whole O -
history O -
. O -

Well O -
, O -
I O -
had O -
better O -
come O -
to O -
the O -
yoke O -
. O -

It O -
is O -
a O -
stiff O -
place O -
, O -
and O -
I O -
feel O -
as O -
though O -
I O -
were O -
bogged O -
up O -
to O -
the O -
axle O -
. O -

But O -
, O -
" O -
_ O -
sutjes O -
, O -
sutjes O -
_ O -
, O -
" O -
as O -
the B-PER (21
Boers I-PER 21)
say O -
-- O -
I O -
am O -
sure O -
I O -
do O -
n't O -
know O -
how O -
they O -
spell O -
it O -
-- O -
softly O -
does O -
it O -
. O -

A O -
strong O -
team O -
will O -
come O -
through O -
at O -
last O -
, O -
that O -
is O -
, O -
if O -
they O -
are O -
not O -
too O -
poor O -
. O -

You O -
can O -
never O -
do O -
anything O -
with O -
poor O -
oxen O -
. O -

Now O -
to O -
make O -
a O -
start O -
. O -

I O -
, O -
Allan B-PER (0
Quatermain I-PER 0)
, O -
of O -
Durban O -
, O -
Natal O -
, O -
Gentleman B-PER (24)
, O -
make O -
oath O -
and O -
say O -
-- O -
That O -
's O -
how O -
I O -
headed O -
my O -
deposition O -
before O -
the B-PER (25
magistrate I-PER 25)
about O -
poor O -
Khiva B-PER (26)
's O -
and O -
Ventvögel B-PER (27)
's O -
sad O -
deaths O -
; O -
but O -
somehow O -
it O -
does O -
n't O -
seem O -
quite O -
the O -
right O -
way O -
to O -
begin O -
a O -
book O -
. O -

And O -
, O -
besides O -
, O -
am O -
I O -
a B-PER (84
gentleman I-PER 84)
? O -

What O -
is O -
a B-PER (28
gentleman I-PER 28)
? O -

I O -
do O -
n't O -
quite O -
know O -
, O -
and O -
yet O -
I O -
have O -
had O -
to O -
do O -
with O -
niggers B-PER (29)
-- O -
no O -
, O -
I O -
will O -
scratch O -
out O -
that O -
word O -
" O -
niggers B-PER -
, O -
" O -
for O -
I O -
do O -
not O -
like O -
it O -
. O -

I O -
've O -
known O -
natives B-PER (30)
who O -
_ O -
are O -
_ O -
, O -
and O -
so O -
you O -
will O -
say O -
, O -
Harry B-PER (12)
, O -
my B-PER (80|(0)
boy I-PER 80)
, O -
before O -
you O -
have O -
done O -
with O -
this O -
tale O -
, O -
and O -
I O -
have O -
known O -
mean O -
whites O -
with O -
lots O -
of O -
money O -
and O -
fresh O -
out O -
from O -
home O -
, O -
too O -
, O -
who O -
_ O -
are O -
not O -
_ O -
. O -

At O -
any O -
rate O -
, O -
I O -
was O -
born O -
a B-PER (81
gentleman I-PER 81)
, O -
though O -
I O -
have O -
been O -
nothing O -
but O -
a B-PER (85
poor I-PER -
travelling I-PER -
trader I-PER -
and I-PER -
hunter I-PER 85)
all O -
my O -
life O -
. O -

Whether O -
I O -
have O -
remained O -
so O -
I O -
known O -
not O -
, O -
you O -
must O -
judge O -
of O -
that O -
. O -

Heaven O -
knows O -
I O -
've O -
tried O -
. O -

I O -
have O -
killed O -
many B-PER (35
men I-PER 35)
in O -
my O -
time O -
, O -
yet O -
I O -
have O -
never O -
slain O -
wantonly O -
or O -
stained O -
my O -
hand O -
in O -
innocent O -
blood O -
, O -
but O -
only O -
in O -
self-defence O -
. O -

The B-PER (36
Almighty I-PER 36)
gave O -
us O -
our O -
lives O -
, O -
and O -
I O -
suppose O -
He B-PER (36)
meant O -
us O -
to O -
defend O -
them O -
, O -
at O -
least O -
I O -
have O -
always O -
acted O -
on O -
that O -
, O -
and O -
I O -
hope O -
it O -
will O -
not O -
be O -
brought O -
up O -
against O -
me O -
when O -
my O -
clock O -
strikes O -
. O -

There O -
, O -
there O -
, O -
it O -
is O -
a O -
cruel O -
and O -
a O -
wicked O -
world O -
, O -
and O -
for O -
a B-PER (0
timid I-PER -
man I-PER 0)
I O -
have O -
been O -
mixed O -
up O -
in O -
a O -
great O -
deal O -
of O -
fighting O -
. O -

I O -
can O -
not O -
tell O -
the O -
rights O -
of O -
it O -
, O -
but O -
at O -
any O -
rate O -
I O -
have O -
never O -
stolen O -
, O -
though O -
once O -
I O -
cheated O -
a B-PER (39
Kafir I-PER 39)
out O -
of O -
a O -
herd O -
of O -
cattle O -
. O -

But O -
then O -
he O -
had O -
done O -
me O -
a O -
dirty O -
turn O -
, O -
and O -
it O -
has O -
troubled O -
me O -
ever O -
since O -
into O -
the O -
bargain O -
. O -

Well O -
, O -
it O -
is O -
eighteen O -
months O -
or O -
so O -
ago O -
since O -
first O -
I O -
met O -
Sir B-PER (1
Henry O -
Curtis O -
and O -
Captain B-PER (5
Good O -
. O -

It O -
was O -
in O -
this O -
way O -
. O -

I O -
had O -
been O -
up O -
elephant O -
hunting O -
beyond O -
Bamangwato O -
, O -
and O -
had O -
met O -
with O -
bad O -
luck O -
. O -

Everything O -
went O -
wrong O -
that O -
trip O -
, O -
and O -
to O -
top O -
up O -
with O -
I O -
got O -
the O -
fever O -
badly O -
. O -

So O -
soon O -
as O -
I O -
was O -
well O -
enough O -
I O -
trekked O -
down O -
to O -
the O -
Diamond O -
Fields O -
, O -
sold O -
such O -
ivory O -
as O -
I O -
had O -
, O -
together O -
with O -
my O -
wagon O -
and O -
oxen O -
, O -
discharged O -
my B-PER (42|(0)
hunters I-PER 42)
, O -
and O -
took O -
the O -
post-cart O -
to O -
the O -
Cape O -
. O -

After O -
spending O -
a O -
week O -
in O -
Cape O -
Town O -
, O -
finding O -
that O -
they O -
overcharged O -
me O -
at O -
the O -
hotel O -
, O -
and O -
having O -
seen O -
everything O -
there O -
was O -
to O -
see O -
, O -
including O -
the O -
botanical O -
gardens O -
, O -
which O -
seem O -
to O -
me O -
likely O -
to O -
confer O -
a O -
great O -
benefit O -
on O -
the O -
country O -
, O -
and O -
the O -
new O -
Houses O -
of O -
Parliament O -
, O -
which O -
I O -
expect O -
will O -
do O -
nothing O -
of O -
the O -
sort O -
, O -
I O -
determined O -
to O -
go O -
back O -
to O -
Natal O -
by O -
the O -
_ O -
Dunkeld O -
_ O -
, O -
then O -

waiting O -
for O -
the O -
_ O -
Edinburgh O -

due O -
in O -
from O -
England O -

I O -
took O -
my O -
berth O -

went O -
aboard O -

and O -
that O -
afternoon O -
the O -
Natal O -
passengers O -
from O -

transhipped O -

we O -

on I-PER -
board I-PER 55)
were O -
two B-PER (57
who I-PER -
excited I-PER -
my I-PER (0)
curiosity I-PER 57)
. O -

One O -
, O -
a B-PER (1
gentleman I-PER -
of I-PER -
about I-PER -
thirty I-PER 1)
, O -
was O -
perhaps O -
the B-PER (86
biggest-chested I-PER -
and I-PER -
longest-armed I-PER -
man I-PER -
I I-PER (0)
ever I-PER -
saw I-PER 86)
. O -

He O -
had O -
yellow O -
hair O -
, O -
a O -
thick O -
yellow O -
beard O -
, O -
clear-cut O -
features O -
, O -
and O -
large O -
grey O -
eyes O -
set O -
deep O -
in O -
his O -
head O -
. O -

I O -
never O -
saw O -
a B-PER (1
finer-looking I-PER -
man I-PER 1)
, O -
and O -
somehow O -
he O -
reminded O -
me O -
of O -
an B-PER (58
ancient I-PER -
Dane I-PER 58)
. O -

Not O -
that O -
I O -
know O -
much O -
of O -
ancient B-PER (59
Danes I-PER 59)
, O -
though O -
I O -
knew O -
a B-PER (60
modern I-PER -
Dane I-PER -
who I-PER -
did I-PER -
me I-PER (0)
out I-PER -
of I-PER -
ten I-PER -
pounds I-PER 60)
; O -
but O -
I O -
remember O -
once O -
seeing O -
a O -
picture O -
of O -
some B-PER (61
of I-PER -
those I-PER -
gentry I-PER 61)
, O -
who O -
, O -
I O -
take O -
it O -
, O -
were O -
a B-PER (61
kind I-PER -
of I-PER -
white I-PER -
Zulus I-PER 61)
. O -

They O -
were O -
drinking O -
out O -
of O -
big O -
horns O -
, O -
and O -
their O -
long O -
hair O -
hung O -
down O -
their O -
backs O -
. O -

As O -
I O -
looked O -
at O -
my B-PER (1|(0)
friend I-PER -
standing I-PER -
there I-PER -
by I-PER -
the I-PER -
companion-ladder I-PER 1)
, O -
I O -
thought O -
that O -
if O -
he O -
only O -
let O -
his O -
grow O -
a O -
little O -
, O -
put O -
one O -
of O -
those O -
chain O -
shirts O -
on O -
to O -
his O -
great O -
shoulders O -
, O -
and O -
took O -
hold O -
of O -
a O -
battle-axe O -
and O -
a O -
horn O -
mug O -
, O -
he O -
might O -
have O -
sat O -
as O -
a B-PER (62
model I-PER -
for I-PER -
that I-PER -
picture I-PER 62)
. O -

And O -
by O -
the O -
way O -
it O -
is O -
a O -
curious O -
thing O -
, O -
and O -
just O -
shows O -
how O -
the O -
blood O -
will O -
out O -
, O -
I O -
discovered O -
afterwards O -
that O -
Sir B-PER (1
Henry O -
Curtis O -
, O -
for O -
that O -
was O -
the B-PER (1
big I-PER -
man I-PER 1)
's O -
name O -
, O -
is O -
of O -
Danish O -
blood O -
. O -

[ O -
1 O -
] O -
He O -
also O -
reminded O -
me O -
strongly O -
of O -
somebody B-PER (63
else I-PER 63)
, O -
but O -
at O -
the O -
time O -
I O -
could O -
not O -
remember O -
who O -
it O -
was O -
. O -

The O -
other O -
man O -
, O -
who O -
stood O -
talking O -
to O -
Sir B-PER (1
Henry O -
, O -
was O -
stout O -
and O -
dark O -
, O -
and O -
of O -
quite O -
a O -
different O -
cut O -
. O -

I O -
suspected O -
at O -
once O -
that O -
he O -
was O -
a B-PER (87
naval I-PER -
officer I-PER 87)
; O -
I O -
do O -
n't O -
know O -
why O -
, O -
but O -
it O -
is O -
difficult O -
to O -
mistake O -
a B-PER (64
navy I-PER -
man I-PER 64)
. O -

I O -
have O -
gone O -
shooting O -
trips O -
with O -
several O -
of O -
them O -
in O -
the O -
course O -
of O -
my O -
life O -
, O -
and O -
they O -
have O -
always O -
proved O -
themselves O -
the B-PER (88
best I-PER -
and I-PER -
bravest I-PER -
and I-PER -
nicest I-PER -
fellows I-PER -
I I-PER (0)
ever I-PER -
met I-PER 88)
, O -
though O -
sadly O -
given O -
, O -
some O -
of O -
them O -
, O -
to O -
the O -
use O -
of O -
profane O -
language O -
. O -

I O -
asked O -
a O -
page O -
or O -
two O -
back O -
, O -
what O -
is O -
a B-PER (65
gentleman I-PER 65)
? O -

I O -
'll O -
answer O -
the O -
question O -
now O -
: O -
A B-PER (66
Royal I-PER -
Naval I-PER -
officer I-PER 66)
is O -
, O -
in O -
a O -
general O -
sort O -
of O -
way O -
, O -
though O -
of O -
course O -
there O -
may O -
be O -
a O -
black O -
sheep O -
among O -
them O -
here O -
and O -
there O -
. O -

I O -
fancy O -
it O -
is O -
just O -
the O -
wide O -
seas O -
and O -
the O -
breath O -
of O -
God B-PER (36)
's O -
winds O -
that O -
wash O -
their O -
hearts O -
and O -
blow O -
the O -
bitterness O -
out O -
of O -
their O -
minds O -
and O -
make O -
them O -
what O -
men B-PER (68)
ought O -
to O -
be O -
. O -

Well O -
, O -
to O -
return O -
, O -
I O -
proved O -
right O -
again O -
; O -
I O -
ascertained O -
that O -
the B-PER (5
dark I-PER -
man I-PER 5)
_ O -
was O -
_ O -
a B-PER (89
naval I-PER -
officer I-PER 89)
, O -
a B-PER (90
lieutenant I-PER -
of I-PER -
thirty-one I-PER 90)
, O -
who O -
, O -
after O -
seventeen O -
years O -
' O -
service O -
, O -
had O -
been O -
turned O -
out O -
of O -
her B-PER (69|(69)
Majesty I-PER 69)
's O -
employ O -
with O -
the O -
barren O -
honour O -
of O -
a B-PER (70
commander I-PER 70)
's O -
rank O -
, O -
because O -
it O -
was O -
impossible O -
that O -
he O -
should O -
be O -
promoted O -
. O -

This O -
is O -
what O -
people O -
who O -
serve O -
the B-PER (69
Queen I-PER 69)|71)
have O -
to O -
expect O -
: O -
to O -
be O -
shot O -
out O -
into O -
the O -
cold O -
world O -
to O -
find O -
a O -
living O -
just O -
when O -
they O -
are O -
beginning O -
really O -
to O -
understand O -
their O -
work O -
, O -
and O -
to O -
reach O -
the O -
prime O -
of O -
life O -
. O -

I O -
suppose O -
they O -
do O -
n't O -
mind O -
it O -
, O -
but O -
for O -
my O -
own O -
part O -
I O -
had O -
rather O -
earn O -
my O -
bread O -
as O -
a B-PER (73
hunter I-PER 73)
. O -

One O -
's O -
halfpence O -
are O -
as O -
scarce O -
perhaps O -
, O -
but O -
you O -
do O -
not O -
get O -
so O -
many O -
kicks O -

The B-PER (5

rather O -
a B-PER (5

. O -

He O -
was O -
so O -
very O -

so O -
very O -
clean-shaved O -

and O -
he O -
always O -
wore O -
an O -

seemed O -

no O -

he O -
never O -
took O -
it O -
out O -

to O -

At O -
first O -
I O -
thought O -
he O -
used O -
to O -
sleep O -
in O -
it O -

but O -
afterwards O -
I O -
found O -
that O -
this O -
was O -
a O -
mistake O -
. O -

He O -
put O -
it O -
in O -
his O -
trousers O -

when O -
he O -
went O -
to O -

together O -
with O -

and O -
housekeeper B-PER (35)
, O -
who O -
had O -
waited O -
up O -
to O -
receive O -
me O -
, O -
were O -
thrown O -
into O -
an O -
awful O -
flutter O -
. O -

They O -
had O -
never O -
seen O -
the O -
like O -
of O -
Sing O -
, O -
and O -
thought O -
that O -
I O -
was O -
introducing O -
a O -
wolf O -
into O -
the O -
fold O -
. O -

I O -
reassured O -
them O -
as O -
to O -
his O -
dogginess O -
, O -
and O -
the B-PER (34
watchman I-PER 34)
, O -
after O -
studying O -
his O -
black O -
tongue O -
, O -
ventured O -
a O -
witticism O -
. O -

He O -
wanted O -
to O -
know O -
if O -
I O -
fed O -
him O -
on O -
huckleberry O -
pie O -
. O -

It O -
was O -
difficult O -
to O -
find O -
accommodations O -
for O -
my B-PER (37|(3)
family I-PER 37)
. O -

Poor O -
Sing O -
was O -
dragged O -
off O -
whimpering O -
to O -
a O -
strange O -
woodshed O -
, O -
and O -
given O -
a O -
piece O -
of O -
burlap O -
. O -

Jane B-PER (30)
did O -
not O -
fare O -
much O -
better O -
. O -

There O -
was O -
not O -
an O -
extra O -
bed O -
in O -
the O -
building O -
, O -
barring O -
a O -
five-foot O -
crib O -
in O -
the O -
hospital O -
room O -
. O -

She O -
, O -
as O -
you O -
know O -
, O -
approaches O -
six O -
. O -

We O -
tucked O -
her O -
in O -
, O -
and O -
she O -
spent O -
the O -
night O -
folded O -
up O -
like O -
a O -
jackknife O -
. O -

She O -
has O -
limped O -
about O -
today O -
, O -
looking O -
like O -
a O -
decrepit O -
letter O -
S O -
, O -
openly O -
deploring O -
this O -
latest O -
escapade O -
on O -
the O -
part O -
of O -
her B-PER (3|(30)
flighty I-PER -
mistress I-PER 3)
, O -
and O -
longing O -
for O -
the O -
time O -
when O -
we O -
shall O -
come O -
to O -
our O -
senses O -
, O -
and O -
return O -
to O -
the O -
parental O -
fireside O -
in O -
Worcester O -
. O -

I O -
know O -
that O -
she O -
is O -
going O -
to O -
spoil O -
all O -
my O -
chances O -
of O -
being O -
popular O -
with O -
the O -
rest O -
of O -
the B-PER (41

. O -

Having O -
her O -
here O -
is O -
the O -
silliest O -
idea O -
that O -
was O -
ever O -
conceived O -
, O -
but O -
you O -
know O -
my B-PER (37|(3)
family I-PER 37)
. O -

I O -
fought O -
their O -
objections O -
step O -
by O -
step O -
, O -
but O -
they O -
made O -
their O -
last O -
stand O -
on O -
Jane O -
. O -

If O -
I O -
brought O -
her O -
along O -
to O -
see O -
that O -
I O -
ate O -
nourishing O -
food O -
and O -
did O -
n't O -
stay O -
up O -
all O -
night O -
, O -
I O -
might O -
come O -
-- O -
temporarily O -
; O -
but O -
if O -
I O -
refused O -
to O -
bring O -
her O -
-- O -
oh O -
, O -
dear O -
me O -
, O -
I O -
am O -
not O -
sure O -
that O -
I O -
was O -
ever O -
again O -
to O -
cross O -
the O -
threshold O -
of O -
Stone O -
Gate O -
! O -

So O -
here O -
we O -
are O -
, O -
and O -
neither O -
of O -
us O -
very O -
welcome O -
, O -
I O -
am O -
afraid O -
. O -

I O -
woke O -
by O -
a O -
gong O -
at O -
six O -
this O -
morning O -
, O -
and O -
lay O -
for O -
a O -
time O -
listening O -
to O -
the O -
racket O -
that O -
twenty-five B-PER (44
little I-PER -
girls I-PER 44)
made O -
in O -
the O -
lavatory O -
over O -
my O -
head O -
. O -

It O -
appears O -
that O -
they O -
do O -
not O -
get O -
baths O -
, O -
-- O -
just O -
face-washes O -
, O -
-- O -
but O -
they O -
make O -
as O -
much O -
splashing O -
as O -
twenty-five O -
puppies O -
in O -
a O -
pool O -
. O -

I O -
rose O -
and O -
dressed O -
and O -
explored O -
a O -
bit O -
. O -

You O -
were O -
wise O -
in O -
not O -
having O -
me O -
come O -
to O -
look O -
the O -
place O -
over O -
before O -
I O -
engaged O -
. O -

While O -
my O -
little O -
charges O -
were O -
at O -
breakfast O -
, O -
it O -
seemed O -
a O -
happy O -
time O -
to O -
introduce O -
myself O -
; O -
so O -
I O -
sought O -
the O -
dining O -
room O -
. O -

Horror O -
piled O -
on O -

those O -

oil-cloth-covered O -

with O -

and O -
, O -
by O -
way O -

that O -

a O -
grim O -
sense O -

Judy B-PER (2)
, O -
I O -
never O -
knew O -
there O -
was O -
any O -
spot O -
in O -
the O -
world O -
so O -
entirely O -
ugly O -
; O -
and O -
when O -
I O -
saw O -
those O -
rows O -
and O -
rows O -
of O -
pale B-PER (44
, I-PER -
listless I-PER -
, I-PER -
blue-uniformed I-PER -
children I-PER 44)
, O -
the O -
whole O -
dismal O -
business O -
suddenly O -
struck O -
me O -
with O -
such O -
a O -
shock O -
that O -
I O -
almost O -
collapsed O -
. O -

It O -
seemed O -
like O -
an O -
unachievable O -
goal O -
for O -
one B-PER (51
person I-PER 51)
to O -
bring O -
sunshine O -
to O -
one O -
hundred O -
little O -
faces O -
when O -
what O -
they O -
need O -
is O -
a B-PER (53
mother I-PER 53)
apiece O -
. O -

I O -
plunged O -
into O -
this O -
thing O -
lightly O -
enough O -
, O -
partly O -
because O -
you O -
were O -
too O -
persuasive O -
, O -
and O -
mostly O -
, O -
I O -
honestly O -
think O -
, O -
because O -
that B-PER (14
scurrilous I-PER -
Gordon I-PER -
Hallock I-PER 14)
laughed O -
so O -
uproariously O -
at O -
the O -
idea O -
of O -
my O -
being O -
able O -
to O -
manage O -
an O -
asylum O -
. O -

Between O -
you O -
all O -
you O -
hypnotized O -
me O -
. O -

And O -
then O -
of O -
course O -
, O -
after O -
I O -
began O -
reading O -
up O -
on O -
the O -
subject O -
and O -
visiting O -
all O -
those O -
seventeen O -
institutions O -
, O -
I O -
got O -
excited O -
over O -
orphans B-PER (57)
, O -
and O -
wanted O -
to O -
put O -
my O -
own O -
ideas O -
into O -
practice O -
. O -

But O -
now O -
I O -
'm O -
aghast O -
at O -
finding O -
myself O -
here O -
; O -
it O -
's O -
such O -
a O -
stupendous O -
undertaking O -
. O -

The O -
future O -
health O -
and O -
happiness O -
of O -
a B-PER (52
hundred I-PER -
human I-PER -
beings I-PER 52)
lie O -
in O -
my O -
hands O -
, O -
to O -
say O -
nothing O -
of O -
their B-PER (58|(52)
three I-PER -
or I-PER -
four I-PER -
hundred I-PER -
children I-PER 58)
and O -
thousand B-PER (59

. O -

The O -
thing O -
's O -
geometrically O -
progressive O -
. O -

It O -
's O -
awful O -
. O -

Who O -
am O -
I O -
to O -
undertake O -
this O -
job O -
? O -

Look O -
, O -
oh O -
, O -
look O -
for O -
another B-PER (60

LATER O -

The B-PER (41

had O -
mutton O -

and O -
spinach O -

with O -

What O -
the B-PER (52

had O -
I O -
hate O -

my O -
featuring O -
the B-PER (65

so O -
prominently O -
. O -

I O -
did O -
it O -
for O -
political O -
reasons O -
. O -

As O -
the O -
entire O -
working O -
staff O -
of O -
the O -
institution O -
was O -
present O -
, O -
I O -
thought O -
it O -
a O -
good O -
opportunity O -
to O -
emphasize O -
the O -
fact O -
that O -
all O -
of O -
these O -
upsetting O -

innovations O -
come O -
straight O -
from O -
headquarters O -
, O -
and O -
not O -
out O -
of O -
my O -
excitable O -
brain O -
. O -

The B-PER (52

stopped O -
eating O -
and O -
stared O -
. O -

The O -
conspicuous O -
color O -
of O -
my O -
hair O -
and O -
the O -
frivolous O -
tilt O -
of O -
my O -
nose O -
are O -
evidently O -
new O -
attributes O -
in O -
a B-PER (66
superintendent I-PER 66)
. O -

My B-PER (41|(3)
colleagues I-PER 41)
also O -
showed O -
plainly O -
that O -
they O -
consider O -
me O -
too O -
young O -
and O -
too O -
inexperienced O -
to O -
be O -
set O -
in O -

I O -
assure O -

have O -
to O -
be O -
VERY O -

make O -
up O -

Miss B-PER (67

clashed O -
early O -
on O -
the O -

but O -
I O -
intend O -
to O -
get O -
rid O -
of O -

I O -

grumbling O -
as O -

struggled O -
into O -
a O -
two-years-too-small O -

They O -
simply O -
stood O -

it O -

about O -

Christianity O -
of O -
the B-PER (52

a O -

roamed O -

Mr. B-PER (2

did O -
not O -

himself O -
, O -
but O -
he O -
liked O -
to O -
be O -
among O -
them O -

it O -
is O -
proof O -
of O -
his O -
pessimism O -
that O -
he O -
had O -
not O -
tried O -
the O -

first O -

To O -
his O -
depressed O -

it O -
had O -
seemed O -
hardly O -
possible O -
that O -
there O -
could O -
be O -

He O -
stood O -
outside O -
the O -

listening O -

He O -
could O -
hear O -
nothing O -

He O -
went O -
in O -
, O -
and O -
for O -
an O -
instant O -
experienced O -
that O -
ecstatic O -
thrill O -

only O -
comes O -
to O -
elderly O -

themselves O -

a O -

Ogden B-PER (27

was O -
round O -

blobby O -

looked O -
overfed O -

He O -
had O -
the O -

this O -
: O -
Tom B-PER (3)

me O -
found O -
the O -
money O -

the B-PER (9

hid O -
in O -
the O -
cave O -
, O -

us O -
rich O -
. O -

We O -
got O -
six O -
thousand O -
dollars O -
apiece O -
-- O -
all O -

It O -
was O -
an O -
awful O -
sight O -
of O -
money O -
when O -
it O -
was O -
piled O -
up O -
. O -

Well O -
, O -
Judge B-PER (12

round O -
-- O -
more O -
than O -
a O -
body O -
could O -
tell O -
what O -
to O -
do O -
with O -
. O -

The B-PER (7
Widow I-PER -
Douglas B-PER 7)
she O -
took O -
me O -
for O -
her B-PER (13|(7)
son I-PER 13)
, O -
and O -
allowed O -
she O -
would O -
sivilize O -
me O -
; O -
but O -
it O -
was O -
rough O -
living O -
in O -
the O -
house O -
all O -
the O -
time O -
, O -
considering O -
how O -
dismal O -
regular O -
and O -
decent O -
the B-PER (7
widow I-PER 7)
was O -
in O -
all O -
her O -
ways O -
; O -
and O -
so O -
when O -
I O -
could O -
n't O -
stand O -
it O -
no O -
longer O -
I O -
lit O -
out O -
. O -

I O -
got O -
into O -
my O -
old O -
rags O -
and O -
my O -
sugar-hogshead O -
again O -
, O -
and O -
was O -
free O -
and O -
satisfied O -
. O -

But O -
Tom B-PER (3
Sawyer I-PER 3)
he O -
hunted O -
me O -
up O -
and O -
said O -
he O -
was O -
going O -
to O -
start O -
a O -
band O -
of O -
robbers B-PER (15)
, O -
and O -
I O -
might O -
join O -
if O -
I O -
would O -
go O -
back O -
to O -
the B-PER (7
widow I-PER 7)
and O -
be O -
respectable O -
. O -

So O -
I O -
went O -
back O -
. O -

The B-PER (7
widow I-PER 7)
she O -
cried O -
over O -
me O -
, O -
and O -
called O -
me O -
a O -
poor O -
lost O -
lamb O -
, O -
and O -
she O -
called O -
me O -
a O -
lot O -
of O -
other O -
names O -
, O -
too O -
, O -
but O -
she O -
never O -
meant O -
no O -
harm O -
by O -
it O -
. O -

She O -
put O -
me O -
in O -
them O -
new O -
clothes O -
again O -
, O -
and O -
I O -
could O -
n't O -
do O -
nothing O -
but O -
sweat O -
and O -
sweat O -
, O -
and O -
feel O -
all O -
cramped O -
up O -
. O -

Well O -
, O -
then O -
, O -
the O -
old O -
thing O -
commenced O -
again O -
. O -

The B-PER (7
widow I-PER 7)
rung O -
a O -
bell O -
for O -
supper O -
, O -
and O -
you O -
had O -
to O -
come O -
to O -
time O -
. O -

When O -
you O -
got O -
to O -
the O -
table O -
you O -
could O -
n't O -
go O -
right O -
to O -
eating O -
, O -
but O -
you O -
had O -
to O -
wait O -
for O -
the B-PER (7
widow I-PER 7)
to O -
tuck O -
down O -
her O -
head O -
and O -
grumble O -
a O -
little O -
over O -
the O -
victuals O -
, O -
though O -
there O -
war O -
n't O -
really O -
anything O -
the O -
matter O -
with O -
them O -
, O -
-- O -
that O -
is O -
, O -
nothing O -
only O -
everything O -
was O -
cooked O -
by O -
itself O -
. O -

In O -
a O -
barrel O -
of O -
odds O -
and O -
ends O -
it O -
is O -
different O -
; O -
things O -
get O -
mixed O -
up O -
, O -
and O -
the O -
juice O -
kind O -
of O -
swaps O -
around O -
, O -
and O -
the O -
things O -
go O -
better O -
. O -

After O -
supper O -
she O -
got O -
out O -
her O -
book O -
and O -
learned O -
me O -
about O -
Moses B-PER (20)
and O -
the B-PER (21
Bulrushers I-PER 21)
, O -
and O -
I O -
was O -
in O -
a O -
sweat O -
to O -
find O -
out O -
all O -
about O -
him O -
; O -
but O -
by O -
and O -
by O -
she O -
let O -
it O -
out O -
that O -
Moses B-PER (20)
had O -
been O -
dead O -
a O -
considerable O -
long O -
time O -
; O -
so O -
then O -
I O -
did O -
n't O -
care O -
no O -
more O -
about O -
him O -
, O -
because O -
I O -
do O -
n't O -
take O -
no O -
stock O -
in O -
dead B-PER (22
people I-PER 22)
. O -

Pretty O -
soon O -
I O -
wanted O -
to O -
smoke O -
, O -
and O -
asked O -
the B-PER (7
widow I-PER 7)
to O -
let O -
me O -
. O -

But O -
she O -
would O -
n't O -
. O -

She O -
said O -
it O -
was O -
a O -
mean O -
practice O -
and O -
was O -
n't O -
clean O -
, O -
and O -
I O -
must O -
try O -
to O -
not O -
do O -
it O -
any O -
more O -
. O -

That O -
is O -
just O -
the O -
way O -
with O -
some B-PER (23
people I-PER 23)
. O -

They O -
get O -
down O -
on O -
a O -
thing O -
when O -
they O -
do O -
n't O -
know O -
nothing O -
about O -
it O -
. O -

Here O -
she O -
was O -
a-bothering O -
about O -
Moses O -
, O -
which O -
was O -
no O -
kin O -
to O -
her O -
, O -
and O -
no O -
use O -
to O -
anybody B-PER (24)
, O -
being O -
gone O -
, O -
you O -
see O -
, O -
yet O -
finding O -
a O -
power O -
of O -
fault O -
with O -
me O -
for O -
doing O -
a O -
thing O -
that O -
had O -
some O -
good O -
in O -
it O -
. O -

And O -
she O -
took O -
snuff O -
, O -
too O -
; O -
of O -
course O -
that O -
was O -
all O -
right O -
, O -
because O -
she O -
done O -
it O -
herself O -
. O -

Her O -
sister O -
, O -
Miss B-PER (62
Watson O -
, O -
a B-PER (61
tolerable I-PER -
slim I-PER -
old I-PER -
maid I-PER 61)
, O -
with O -
goggles O -
on O -
, O -
had O -
just O -
come O -
to O -
live O -
with O -
her O -
, O -
and O -
took O -
a O -
set O -
at O -
me O -
now O -
with O -
a O -
spelling-book O -
. O -

She O -
worked O -
me O -
middling O -
hard O -
for O -
about O -
an O -
hour O -
, O -
and O -
then O -
the B-PER (7
widow I-PER 7)
made O -
her O -
ease O -
up O -
. O -

I O -
could O -
n't O -
stood O -
it O -
much O -
longer O -
. O -

Then O -
for O -
an O -
hour O -
it O -
was O -
deadly O -
dull O -
, O -
and O -
I O -
was O -
fidgety O -
. O -

Miss B-PER (26
Watson O -
would O -
say O -
, O -
“ O -
Do O -
n't O -
put O -
your O -
feet O -
up O -
there O -
, O -
Huckleberry B-PER (1)
; O -
” O -
and O -
“ O -
Do O -
n't O -
scrunch O -
up O -
like O -
that O -
, O -
Huckleberry B-PER (1)
-- O -
set O -
up O -
straight O -
; O -
” O -
and O -
pretty O -
soon O -
she O -
would O -
say O -
, O -
“ O -
Do O -
n't O -
gap O -
and O -
stretch O -
like O -
that O -
, O -
Huckleberry B-PER (1)
-- O -
why O -
do O -
n't O -
you O -
try O -
to O -
behave O -
? O -
” O -

Then O -
she O -
told O -
me O -
all O -
about O -
the O -
bad O -
place O -
, O -
and O -
I O -
said O -
I O -
wished O -
I O -
was O -
there O -
. O -

She O -
got O -
mad O -
then O -
, O -
but O -
I O -
did O -
n't O -
mean O -
no O -
harm O -
. O -

All O -
I O -
wanted O -
was O -
to O -
go O -
somewheres O -
; O -
all O -
I O -
wanted O -
was O -
a O -
change O -
, O -
I O -
war O -
n't O -
particular O -
. O -

She O -
said O -
it O -
was O -
wicked O -
to O -
say O -
what O -
I O -
said O -
; O -
said O -
she O -
would O -
n't O -
say O -
it O -
for O -
the O -
whole O -
world O -
; O -
she O -
was O -
going O -
to O -
live O -
so O -
as O -
to O -
go O -
to O -
the O -
good O -
place O -
. O -

Well O -
, O -
I O -
could O -
n't O -
see O -
no O -
advantage O -
in O -
going O -
where O -
she O -
was O -
going O -
, O -
so O -
I O -
made O -
up O -
my O -
mind O -
I O -
would O -
n't O -
try O -
for O -
it O -
. O -

But O -
I O -
never O -
said O -
so O -
, O -
because O -
it O -
would O -
only O -
make O -
trouble O -
, O -
and O -
would O -
n't O -
do O -
no O -
good O -
. O -

Now O -
she O -
had O -
got O -
a O -
start O -
, O -
and O -
she O -
went O -
on O -
and O -
told O -
me O -
all O -
about O -
the O -
good O -
place O -
. O -

She O -
said O -
all O -
a B-PER (30
body I-PER 30)
would O -
have O -
to O -
do O -
there O -
was O -
to O -
go O -
around O -
all O -
day O -
long O -
with O -
a O -
harp O -
and O -
sing O -
, O -
forever O -
and O -
ever O -
. O -

So O -
I O -
did O -
n't O -
think O -
much O -
of O -
it O -
. O -

But O -
I O -
never O -
said O -
so O -
. O -

I O -
asked O -
her O -
if O -
she O -
reckoned O -
Tom B-PER (3
Sawyer I-PER 3)
would O -
go O -
there O -
, O -
and O -
she O -
said O -
not O -
by O -
a O -
considerable O -
sight O -
. O -

I O -
was O -
glad O -
about O -
that O -
, O -
because O -
I O -
wanted O -
him O -
and O -
me O -
to O -
be O -
together O -
. O -

Miss B-PER (26
Watson O -
she O -
kept O -
pecking O -
at O -
me O -
, O -
and O -
it O -
got O -
tiresome O -
and O -
lonesome O -
. O -

By O -
and O -
by O -
they O -
fetched O -
the B-PER (32
niggers I-PER 32)
in O -
and O -
had O -
prayers O -
, O -
and O -
then O -
everybody B-PER (33)
was O -
off O -
to O -
bed O -
. O -

I O -
went O -
up O -
to O -
my O -
room O -
with O -
a O -
piece O -
of O -
candle O -
, O -
and O -
put O -
it O -
on O -
the O -
table O -
. O -

Then O -
I O -
set O -
down O -
in O -
a O -
chair O -
by O -
the O -
window O -
and O -
tried O -
to O -
think O -
of O -
something O -
cheerful O -
, O -
but O -
it O -
war O -
n't O -
no O -
use O -
. O -

I O -
felt O -
so O -
lonesome O -
I O -
most O -
wished O -
I O -
was O -
dead O -
. O -

The O -
stars O -
were O -
shining O -
, O -
and O -
the O -
leaves O -
rustled O -
in O -
the O -
woods O -
ever O -
so O -
mournful O -
; O -
and O -
I O -
heard O -
an O -
owl O -
, O -
away O -
off O -
, O -
who-whooing O -
about O -
somebody B-PER (35
that I-PER -
was I-PER -
dead I-PER 35)
, O -
and O -
a O -
whippowill O -
and O -
a O -
dog O -
crying O -
about O -
somebody B-PER (36
that I-PER -
was I-PER -
going I-PER -
to I-PER -
die I-PER 36)
; O -
and O -
the O -
wind O -
was O -
trying O -
to O -
whisper O -
something O -
to O -
me O -
, O -
and O -
I O -
could O -
n't O -
make O -
out O -
what O -
it O -
was O -
, O -
and O -
so O -
it O -
made O -
the O -
cold O -
shivers O -
run O -
over O -
me O -
. O -

Then O -
away O -
out O -
in O -
the O -
woods O -
I O -
heard O -
that O -
kind O -
of O -
a O -
sound O -
that O -
a O -
ghost O -
makes O -
when O -
it O -
wants O -
to O -
tell O -
about O -
something O -
that O -
's O -
on O -
its O -
mind O -
and O -
ca O -
n't O -
make O -
itself O -
understood O -
, O -
and O -
so O -
ca O -
n't O -
rest O -
easy O -
in O -
its O -
grave O -
, O -
and O -
has O -
to O -
go O -
about O -
that O -
way O -
every O -
night O -
grieving O -
. O -

I O -
got O -
so O -
down-hearted O -
and O -
scared O -
I O -
did O -
wish O -
I O -
had O -
some B-PER (39
company I-PER 39)
. O -

Pretty O -
soon O -
a O -
spider O -
went O -
crawling O -
up O -
my O -
shoulder O -
, O -
and O -
I O -
flipped O -
it O -
off O -
and O -
it O -
lit O -
in O -
the O -
candle O -
; O -
and O -
before O -
I O -
could O -
budge O -
it O -
was O -
all O -
shriveled O -
up O -
. O -

I O -
did O -
n't O -
need O -
anybody B-PER (40)
to O -
tell O -
me O -
that O -
that O -
was O -
an O -
awful O -
bad O -
sign O -
and O -
would O -
fetch O -
me O -
some O -
bad O -
luck O -
, O -
so O -
I O -
was O -
scared O -
and O -
most O -
shook O -
the O -
clothes O -
off O -
of O -
me O -
. O -

I O -
got O -
up O -
and O -
turned O -
around O -
in O -
my O -
tracks O -
three O -
times O -
and O -
crossed O -
my O -
breast O -
every O -
time O -
; O -
and O -
then O -
I O -
tied O -
up O -
a O -
little O -
lock O -
of O -
my O -
hair O -
with O -
a O -
thread O -
to O -
keep O -
witches B-PER (41)
away O -
. O -

But O -
I O -
had O -
n't O -
no O -
confidence O -
. O -

You O -
do O -
that O -
when O -
you O -
've O -
lost O -
a O -
horseshoe O -
that O -
you O -
've O -
found O -
, O -
instead O -
of O -
nailing O -
it O -
up O -
over O -
the O -
door O -
, O -
but O -
I O -
had O -
n't O -
ever O -
heard O -
anybody B-PER (45)
say O -
it O -
was O -
any O -
way O -
to O -
keep O -
off O -
bad O -
luck O -
when O -
you O -
'd O -
killed O -
a O -
spider O -
. O -

I O -
set O -
down O -
again O -
, O -
a-shaking O -
all O -
over O -
, O -
and O -
got O -
out O -
my O -
pipe O -
for O -
a O -
smoke O -
; O -
for O -
the O -
house O -
was O -
all O -
as O -
still O -
as O -
death O -
now O -
, O -
and O -
so O -
the B-PER (7
widow I-PER 7)
would O -
n't O -
know O -
. O -

Well O -
, O -
after O -
a O -
long O -
time O -
I O -
heard O -
the O -
clock O -
away O -
off O -
in O -
the O -
town O -
go O -
boom O -
-- O -
boom O -
-- O -
boom O -
-- O -
twelve O -
licks O -
; O -
and O -
all O -
still O -
again O -
-- O -
stiller O -
than O -
ever O -
. O -

Pretty O -
soon O -
I O -
heard O -
a O -
twig O -
snap O -
down O -
in O -
the O -
dark O -
amongst O -
the O -
trees O -
-- O -
something O -
was O -
a O -
stirring O -
. O -

I O -
set O -
still O -
and O -
listened O -
. O -

Directly O -
I O -
could O -
just O -
barely O -
hear O -
a O -
“ O -
me-yow O -

me-yow O -

” O -

down O -
there O -

That O -

Says O -
I O -
, O -
“ O -
me-yow O -

me-yow O -
! O -
” O -

as O -
soft O -
as O -
I O -
could O -
, O -
and O -
then O -
I O -
put O -
out O -
the O -
light O -
and O -
scrambled O -
out O -
of O -
the O -
window O -
on O -
to O -
the O -
shed O -
. O -

Then O -
I O -
slipped O -
down O -
to O -
the O -
ground O -
and O -
crawled O -
in O -
among O -
the O -
trees O -
, O -
and O -
, O -
sure O -
enough O -
, O -
there O -
was O -

CHAPTER O -

WE O -
went O -
tiptoeing O -
along O -
a O -
path O -
amongst O -
the O -
trees O -
back O -
towards O -
the O -
end O -
of O -
the B-PER (49|(7

, O -
stooping O -
down O -
so O -
as O -
the O -
branches O -
would O -
n't O -
scrape O -
our O -
heads O -

When O -
we O -
was O -
passing O -
by O -
the O -

I O -
fell O -
over O -
a O -
root O -
and O -
made O -
a O -
noise O -

We O -
scrouched O -
down O -
and O -
laid O -
still O -

Miss B-PER (26|(51

Jim B-PER (51)
, O -
was O -
setting O -
in O -
the O -
kitchen O -
door O -
; O -
we O -
could O -
see O -
him O -
pretty O -
clear O -
, O -
because O -
there O -
was O -
a O -
light O -
behind O -
him O -
. O -

He O -
got O -
up O -
and O -
stretched O -
his O -
neck O -
out O -
about O -
a O -
minute O -
, O -
listening O -
. O -

Then O -
he O -
says O -
: O -
“ O -
Who O -
dah O -
? O -
” O -

He O -
listened O -
some O -
more O -
; O -
then O -
he O -
come O -
tiptoeing O -
down O -
and O -
stood O -
right O -
between O -
us O -
; O -
we O -
could O -
a O -
touched O -
him O -
, O -
nearly O -
. O -

Well O -
, O -
likely O -
it O -
was O -
minutes O -
and O -
minutes O -
that O -
there O -
war O -
n't O -
a O -
sound O -
, O -
and O -
we O -
all O -
there O -
so O -
close O -
together O -
. O -

There O -
was O -
a O -
place O -
on O -
my O -
ankle O -
that O -
got O -
to O -
itching O -
, O -
but O -
I O -
das O -
n't O -

; O -
and O -
then O -
my O -
ear O -
begun O -
to O -
itch O -
; O -
and O -
next O -
my O -
back O -
, O -
right O -
between O -
my O -
shoulders O -
. O -

Seemed O -
like O -
I O -
'd O -
die O -
if O -
I O -
could O -
n't O -
scratch O -
. O -

Well O -
, O -
I O -
've O -
noticed O -
that O -
thing O -
plenty O -
times O -
since O -
. O -

If O -
you O -

over O -
in O -
upwards O -
of O -
a O -
thousand O -
places O -

Pretty O -

Jim B-PER (51)

So O -
he O -
set O -
down O -
on O -
the O -
ground O -
betwixt O -
me O -
and O -
Tom B-PER (3)
. O -

He O -
leaned O -
his O -
back O -
up O -
against O -
a O -
tree O -
, O -
and O -
stretched O -
his O -
legs O -
out O -

Then O -
it O -
begun O -
to O -

on O -
the O -
inside O -

Next O -
I O -
got O -
to O -
itching O -

I O -
did O -
n't O -

This O -
miserableness O -
went O -
on O -
as O -
much O -
as O -
six O -
or O -
seven O -
minutes O -
; O -
but O -
it O -
seemed O -
a O -
sight O -
longer O -
than O -
that O -
. O -

I O -
was O -
itching O -
in O -
eleven O -
different O -
places O -
now O -
. O -

I O -
reckoned O -
I O -
could O -
n't O -
stand O -
it O -
more O -
'n O -
a O -
minute O -
longer O -
, O -
but O -
I O -
set O -
my O -
teeth O -

Just O -

it O -

that O -

some O -
fifteen O -

twenty O -
years O -
after O -
the O -
settlement O -

already O -
marked O -

weather-stains O -

gave O -
a O -

darker O -
aspect O -
to O -
its O -
beetle-browed O -

The O -
rust O -
on O -
the O -

of O -

looked O -
more O -

CHAPTER O -
1 O -
The O -
studio O -
was O -
filled O -
with O -
the O -
rich O -
odour O -
of O -
roses O -
, O -
and O -
when O -
the O -
light O -
summer O -
wind O -
stirred O -
amidst O -
the O -
trees O -
of O -
the O -
garden O -
, O -
there O -
came O -
through O -
the O -
open O -
door O -
the O -
heavy O -
scent O -
of O -
the O -
lilac O -
, O -
or O -
the O -
more O -
delicate O -
perfume O -
of O -
the O -
pink-flowering O -
thorn O -
. O -

From O -
the O -
corner O -
of O -
the O -
divan O -
of O -
Persian O -
saddle-bags O -
on O -
which O -
he O -
was O -
lying O -
, O -
smoking O -
, O -
as O -
was O -
his O -
custom O -
, O -
innumerable O -
cigarettes O -
, O -
Lord B-PER (2
Henry O -
Wotton O -
could O -
just O -
catch O -
the O -
gleam O -
of O -
the O -
honey-sweet O -
and O -
honey-coloured O -
blossoms O -
of O -
a O -
laburnum O -
, O -
whose O -
tremulous O -
branches O -
seemed O -
hardly O -
able O -
to O -
bear O -
the O -
burden O -
of O -
a O -
beauty O -
so O -
flamelike O -
as O -
theirs O -
; O -
and O -
now O -
and O -
then O -
the O -
fantastic O -
shadows O -
of O -
birds O -
in O -
flight O -
flitted O -
across O -
the O -
long O -
tussore-silk O -
curtains O -
that O -
were O -
stretched O -
in O -
front O -
of O -
the O -
huge O -
window O -
, O -
producing O -
a O -
kind O -
of O -
momentary O -
Japanese O -
effect O -
, O -
and O -
making O -
him O -
think O -
of O -
those O -
pallid O -
, O -
jade-faced O -
painters O -
of O -
Tokyo O -
who O -
, O -
through O -
the O -
medium O -
of O -
an O -
art O -
that O -
is O -
necessarily O -
immobile O -
, O -
seek O -
to O -
convey O -
the O -
sense O -
of O -
swiftness O -
and O -
motion O -
. O -

The O -
sullen O -
murmur O -
of O -
the O -
bees O -
shouldering O -
their O -
way O -
through O -
the O -
long O -
unmown O -
grass O -
, O -
or O -
circling O -
with O -
monotonous O -
insistence O -
round O -
the O -
dusty O -
gilt O -
horns O -
of O -
the O -
straggling O -
woodbine O -
, O -
seemed O -
to O -
make O -
the O -
stillness O -
more O -
oppressive O -
. O -

The O -
dim O -
roar O -
of O -
London O -
was O -
like O -
the O -
bourdon O -
note O -
of O -
a O -
distant O -
organ O -
. O -

In O -
the O -
centre O -
of O -
the O -
room O -
, O -
clamped O -
to O -
an O -
upright O -
easel O -
, O -
stood O -
the O -
full-length O -
portrait O -
of O -
a B-PER (6
young I-PER -
man I-PER -
of I-PER -
extraordinary I-PER -
personal I-PER -
beauty I-PER 6)
, O -
and O -
in O -
front O -
of O -
it O -
, O -
some O -
little O -
distance O -
away O -
, O -
was O -
sitting O -
the B-PER (7
artist I-PER -
himself I-PER 7)|(7)
, O -
Basil B-PER (42
Hallward I-PER 42)
, O -
whose O -
sudden O -
disappearance O -
some O -
years O -
ago O -
caused O -
, O -
at O -
the O -
time O -
, O -
such O -
public O -
excitement O -
and O -
gave O -
rise O -
to O -
so O -
many O -
strange O -
conjectures O -
. O -

As O -
the B-PER (7
painter I-PER 7)
looked O -
at O -
the O -
gracious O -
and O -
comely O -
form O -
he O -
had O -
so O -
skilfully O -
mirrored O -
in O -
his O -
art O -
, O -
a O -
smile O -
of O -
pleasure O -
passed O -
across O -
his O -
face O -
, O -
and O -
seemed O -
about O -
to O -
linger O -
there O -
. O -

But O -
he O -
suddenly O -
started O -
up O -
, O -
and O -
closing O -
his O -
eyes O -
, O -
placed O -
his O -
fingers O -
upon O -
the O -
lids O -
, O -
as O -
though O -
he O -
sought O -
to O -
imprison O -
within O -
his O -
brain O -
some O -
curious O -
dream O -
from O -
which O -
he O -
feared O -
he O -
might O -
awake O -
. O -

" O -
It O -
is O -
your O -
best O -
work O -
, O -
Basil B-PER (7)
, O -
the O -
best O -
thing O -

ever O -
done O -

" O -
said O -
Lord B-PER (2

languidly O -
. O -

" O -
You O -
must O -
certainly O -
send O -
it O -
next O -
year O -
to O -
the O -
Grosvenor O -

The O -
Academy O -
is O -
too O -
large O -
and O -
too O -
vulgar O -
. O -

Whenever O -
I O -
have O -
gone O -
there O -
, O -
there O -
have O -
been O -
either O -
so B-PER (10
many I-PER -

that O -
I O -

not O -

the O -

I O -

worse O -

The O -
Grosvenor O -
is O -
really O -
the O -
only O -
place O -

" O -

" O -
I O -
do O -
n't O -
think O -
I O -
shall O -
send O -
it O -
anywhere O -
, O -
" O -
he O -
answered O -
, O -
tossing O -
his O -
head O -
back O -
in O -
that O -
odd O -
way O -
that O -
used O -
to O -
make O -
his B-PER (11|(7)
friends I-PER 11)
laugh O -
at O -
him O -
at O -
Oxford O -
. O -

" O -
No O -
, O -
I O -
wo O -
n't O -
send O -
it O -
anywhere O -

" O -

Lord B-PER (2
Henry O -
elevated O -
his O -
eyebrows O -
and O -
looked O -
at O -
him O -
in O -
amazement O -
through O -
the O -
thin O -
blue O -
wreaths O -
of O -
smoke O -
that O -
curled O -
up O -
in O -
such O -
fanciful O -
whorls O -
from O -
his O -
heavy O -
, O -
opium-tainted O -
cigarette O -
. O -

" O -
Not O -

it O -

My B-PER (7|(2)
dear I-PER -

why O -
? O -

Have O -
you O -
any O -
reason O -
? O -

What B-PER (13
odd I-PER -
chaps I-PER 13)
you B-PER (14

! O -

You O -

anything O -

the O -

a O -
reputation O -

As O -
soon O -

you O -

one O -

to O -

It O -

of O -
you O -

only O -
one O -

A O -

set O -
you O -
far O -
above O -
all O -
the O -
young O -
men O -

make O -
the B-PER (18

I O -

put O -
too O -
much O -
of O -
myself O -
into O -

Lord B-PER (2

stretched O -
himself O -
out O -
on O -
the O -
divan O -

laughed O -

" O -
Yes O -

my O -

Basil B-PER (7)
, O -
I O -
did O -

you O -

so O -
vain O -
; O -

I O -
really O -
ca O -
n't O -
see O -
any O -

this B-PER (6

looks O -
as O -

out O -

Why O -
, O -
my B-PER (7|(2)

is O -
a B-PER (43

you O -

well O -
, O -
of O -
course O -
you O -
have O -
an O -
intellectual O -
expression O -
and O -
all O -
that O -

But O -
beauty O -
, O -
real O -
beauty O -
, O -
ends O -
where O -
an O -
intellectual O -
expression O -
begins O -
. O -

Intellect O -
is O -
in O -
itself O -
a O -
mode O -
of O -
exaggeration O -
, O -
and O -
destroys O -
the O -
harmony O -
of O -
any O -
face O -

The O -
moment O -
one O -

down O -

then O -
in O -

A B-PER (21

that O -

the O -

that O -

The B-PER (41

are O -
persuaded O -
that O -
I O -
am O -

out O -

But O -
why O -
cook O -
when O -
you O -
can O -

some O -

you O -

And O -

the B-PER (44

We O -
had O -
been O -
married O -
five O -
years O -
before O -
it O -
struck O -
us O -
that O -
we O -
might O -
as O -
well O -
make O -
use O -
of O -
this O -
place O -
by O -
coming O -
down O -
and O -
living O -
in O -
it O -
. O -

Those O -
five O -
years O -
were O -
spent O -
in O -
a O -
flat O -
in O -
a O -
town O -
, O -
and O -
during O -
their O -
whole O -
interminable O -
length O -
I O -
was O -
perfectly O -
miserable O -
and O -
perfectly O -
healthy O -
, O -
which O -
disposes O -
of O -
the O -
ugly O -
notion O -
that O -
has O -
at O -
times O -
disturbed O -
me O -
that O -
my O -
happiness O -
here O -
is O -
less O -
due O -
to O -
the O -
garden O -
than O -
to O -
a O -
good O -
digestion O -

And O -
while O -
we O -
were O -
wasting O -
our O -
lives O -
there O -
, O -
here O -
was O -
this O -
dear O -
place O -
with O -
dandelions O -
up O -

the O -

all O -

grass-grown O -

completely O -

in O -

so O -
lonely O -
, O -
with O -
nobody B-PER (51

the O -

all O -

not O -

entering O -
the O -
empty O -
house O -
except O -
the O -
snakes O -
, O -
which O -
got O -
into O -
the O -
habit O -
during O -
those O -
silent O -
years O -
of O -
wriggling O -
up O -
the O -
south O -

into O -
the O -

on O -
that O -
side O -
whenever O -
the B-PER (54

All O -

never O -

Looking O -
back O -
I O -
am O -
astonished O -
, O -
and O -
can O -
in O -
no O -
way O -
account O -
for O -
the O -
tardiness O -
of O -
my O -
discovery O -
that O -
here O -
, O -
in O -
this O -
far-away O -
corner O -
, O -
was O -
my O -
kingdom O -

Indeed O -
, O -
so O -
little O -
did O -
it O -
enter O -
my O -
head O -
to O -
even O -
use O -
the O -
place O -
in O -
summer O -
, O -
that O -
I O -
submitted O -
to O -
weeks O -
of O -
seaside O -
life O -
with O -
all O -
its O -
horrors O -
every O -
year O -
; O -
until O -
at O -
last O -
, O -
in O -
the O -
early O -
spring O -
of O -
last O -

, O -
having O -
come O -
down O -
for O -
the O -
opening O -

the O -
village O -

, O -
and O -
wandering O -
out O -
afterwards O -
into O -
the O -
bare O -

desolate O -
garden O -

I O -
do O -
n’t O -
know O -
what O -
smell O -
of O -
wet O -
earth O -
or O -
rotting O -

brought O -
back O -
my O -
childhood O -
with O -
a O -
rush O -
and O -
all O -
the O -
happy O -
days O -
I O -
had O -
spent O -
in O -
a O -
garden O -
. O -

Shall O -
I O -
ever O -
forget O -
that O -
day O -
? O -

It O -
was O -
the O -
beginning O -
of O -
my O -
real O -
life O -
, O -
my O -
coming O -
of O -
age O -
as O -

Early O -

brown O -
, O -
quiet O -
earth O -

leafless O -

sad O -

lonely O -
enough O -
out O -
there O -
in O -
the O -
damp O -
and O -
silence O -
, O -
yet O -
there O -
I O -
stood O -
feeling O -
the O -
same O -
rapture O -
of O -
pure O -
delight O -
in O -
the O -
first O -
breath O -
of O -
spring O -
that O -
I O -
used O -
to O -
as O -
a B-PER (59
child I-PER 59)
, O -
and O -
the O -
five O -
wasted O -
years O -
fell O -
from O -
me O -
like O -
a O -
cloak O -
, O -
and O -
the O -
world O -
was O -
full O -
of O -
hope O -
, O -
and O -
I O -
vowed O -
myself O -
then O -
and O -
there O -
to O -
nature O -
, O -
and O -
have O -
been O -
happy O -
ever O -
since O -
. O -

My O -
other O -
half O -
being O -
indulgent O -
, O -
and O -
with O -
some O -
faint O -
thought O -
perhaps O -
that O -
it O -
might O -
be O -
as O -
well O -
to O -
look O -
after O -
the O -
place O -
, O -
consented O -
to O -
live O -
in O -
it O -
at O -
any O -
rate O -
for O -
a O -
time O -
; O -
whereupon O -
followed O -
six O -
specially O -
blissful O -
weeks O -
from O -
the O -
end O -
of O -
April O -
into O -
June O -
, O -
during O -
which O -
I O -
was O -
here O -
alone O -
, O -
supposed O -
to O -
be O -
superintending O -
the O -
painting O -
and O -
papering O -
, O -
but O -
as O -
a O -
matter O -
of O -
fact O -
only O -
going O -
into O -
the O -
house O -
when O -
the B-PER (61
workmen I-PER 61)
had O -
gone O -
out O -
of O -
it O -
. O -

How O -
happy O -
I O -
was O -
! O -

I O -
do O -
n’t O -
remember O -
any O -
time O -
quite O -
so O -
perfect O -
since O -
the O -
days O -
when O -
I O -
was O -
too O -
little O -
to O -
do O -
lessons O -
and O -
was O -
turned O -
out O -
with O -
sugar O -
on O -
my O -
eleven O -
o’clock O -
bread O -
and O -
butter O -
on O -
to O -
a O -
lawn O -
closely O -
strewn O -
with O -
dandelions O -
and O -
daisies O -
. O -

The O -
sugar O -
on O -
the O -
bread O -
and O -
butter O -
has O -
lost O -
its O -
charm O -
, O -
but O -
I O -
love O -
the O -
dandelions O -
and O -
daisies O -
even O -
more O -
passionately O -
now O -
than O -
then O -
, O -
and O -
never O -
would O -
endure O -
to O -
see O -
them O -
all O -
mown O -
away O -
if O -
I O -
were O -
not O -
certain O -
that O -
in O -
a O -
day O -
or O -
two O -
they O -
would O -
be O -
pushing O -
up O -
their O -
little O -
faces O -
again O -
as O -
jauntily O -
as O -
ever O -
. O -

During O -
those O -
six O -
weeks O -
I O -
lived O -
in O -
a O -
world O -
of O -
dandelions O -
and O -
delights O -
. O -

The O -
dandelions O -
carpeted O -
the O -
three O -
lawns O -
, O -
-- O -
they O -
used O -
to O -
be O -
lawns O -
, O -
but O -
have O -
long O -
since O -
blossomed O -
out O -
into O -
meadows O -
filled O -
with O -
every O -
sort O -
of O -
pretty O -
weed O -
, O -
-- O -
and O -
under O -
and O -
among O -
the O -
groups O -
of O -
leafless O -
oaks O -
and O -
beeches O -
were O -
blue O -
hepaticas O -
, O -
white O -
anemones O -
, O -
violets O -
, O -
and O -
celandines O -
in O -
sheets O -
. O -

The O -
celandines O -
in O -
particular O -
delighted O -
me O -
with O -
their O -
clean O -
, O -
happy O -
brightness O -
, O -
so O -
beautifully O -
trim O -
and O -
newly O -
varnished O -
, O -
as O -
though O -
they O -
too O -
had O -
had O -
the B-PER (63
painters I-PER 63)
at O -
work O -
on O -
them O -
. O -

Then O -
, O -
when O -
the O -
anemones O -
went O -
, O -
came O -
a O -
few O -
stray O -
periwinkles O -
and O -
Solomon O -
’s O -
Seal O -
, O -
and O -
all O -
the O -
birdcherries O -
blossomed O -
in O -
a O -
burst O -
. O -

And O -
then O -
, O -
before O -
I O -
had O -
a O -
little O -
got O -
used O -
to O -
the O -
joy O -
of O -
their O -
flowers O -
against O -
the O -
sky O -
, O -
came O -
the O -
lilacs O -
-- O -
masses O -
and O -
masses O -
of O -
them O -
, O -
in O -
clumps O -
on O -

, O -
with O -
other O -
shrubs O -
and O -
trees O -
by O -
the O -
side O -
of O -
walks O -

and O -
one O -

as O -
one O -

see O -

When O -

few B-PER (27
friends I-PER 27)
, O -
my O -
business O -
began O -
to O -
fail O -
; O -
for O -
my O -
conscience O -
would O -
not O -
suffer O -
me O -
to O -
imitate O -
the O -
bad O -
practice O -
of O -
too O -
many O -
among O -
my B-PER (29|(1)
brethren I-PER 29)
. O -

Having O -
therefore O -
consulted O -
with O -
my B-PER (24|(1)
wife I-PER 24)
, O -
and O -
some B-PER (30
of I-PER -
my I-PER (1)
acquaintance I-PER 30)
, O -
I O -
determined O -
to O -
go O -
again O -
to O -
sea O -
. O -

I O -
was O -
surgeon B-PER (32)
successively O -
in O -
two O -
ships O -
, O -
and O -
made O -
several O -
voyages O -
, O -
for O -
six O -
years O -
, O -
to O -
the O -
East O -
and O -
West O -
Indies O -
, O -
by O -
which O -
I O -
got O -
some O -
addition O -
to O -
my O -
fortune O -
. O -

My O -
hours O -
of O -
leisure O -
I O -
spent O -
in O -
reading O -
the B-PER (35
best I-PER -
authors I-PER -
, I-PER -
ancient I-PER -
and I-PER -
modern I-PER 35)
, O -
being O -
always O -
provided O -
with O -
a O -
good O -
number O -
of O -
books O -
; O -
and O -
when O -
I O -
was O -
ashore O -
, O -
in O -
observing O -
the O -
manners O -
and O -
dispositions O -
of O -
the B-PER (36

, O -
as O -
well O -
as O -
learning O -
their O -
language O -
; O -
wherein O -
I O -
had O -
a O -
great O -
facility O -
, O -
by O -
the O -
strength O -
of O -
my O -
memory O -
. O -

The O -
last O -
of O -
these O -
voyages O -
not O -
proving O -
very O -
fortunate O -
, O -
I O -
grew O -
weary O -
of O -
the O -
sea O -
, O -
and O -
intended O -
to O -
stay O -
at O -
home O -
with O -
my B-PER (24|(1)
wife I-PER 24)
and O -
family B-PER (38)
. O -

I O -
removed O -
from O -
the O -
Old O -
Jewry O -
to O -
Fetter O -
Lane O -
, O -
and O -
from O -
thence O -
to O -
Wapping O -

hoping O -
to O -
get O -
business O -
among O -
the B-PER (41

; O -
but O -
it O -
would O -
not O -
turn O -
to O -
account O -
. O -

After O -
three O -
years O -
expectation O -
that O -
things O -
would O -
mend O -
, O -
I O -
accepted O -
an O -
advantageous O -

from O -
Captain B-PER (42

master B-PER (96

who O -
was O -
making O -
a O -
voyage O -
to O -
the O -

We O -
set O -

from O -

1699 O -
, O -
and O -
our O -
voyage O -
was O -
at O -
first O -
very O -
prosperous O -

It O -
would O -
not O -
be O -
proper O -
, O -
for O -
some O -
reasons O -
, O -
to O -
trouble O -
the B-PER (46

with O -
the O -
particulars O -
of O -
our O -
adventures O -
in O -
those O -

let O -
it O -
suffice O -
to O -
inform O -
him O -

that O -
in O -
our O -
passage O -
from O -
thence O -
to O -
the O -
East O -

, O -
we O -
were O -
driven O -
by O -
a O -
violent O -

to O -
the O -
north-west O -
of O -
Van O -

By O -
an O -

we O -
found O -
ourselves O -
in O -
the O -

Twelve B-PER (52

our I-PER (50)

were O -
dead O -
by O -
immoderate O -
labour O -
and O -
ill O -
food O -
; O -
the B-PER (53

were O -
in O -
a O -
very O -
weak O -
condition O -
. O -

On O -
the O -
5th O -
of O -
November O -
, O -
which O -
was O -
the O -
beginning O -
of O -
summer O -
in O -
those O -
parts O -
, O -
the O -
weather O -
being O -
very O -
hazy O -
, O -
the B-PER (53

spied O -
a O -
rock O -
within O -
half O -
a O -
cable O -
’s O -
length O -
of O -
the O -
ship O -
; O -
but O -
the O -
wind O -
was O -
so O -
strong O -
, O -
that O -
we O -
were O -
driven O -
directly O -
upon O -
it O -
, O -
and O -
immediately O -
split O -
. O -

Six B-PER (54
of I-PER -
the I-PER -
crew I-PER 54)
, O -
of O -
whom O -
I O -
was O -
one O -
, O -
having O -
let O -
down O -
the O -
boat O -
into O -
the O -
sea O -
, O -
made O -
a O -
shift O -
to O -
get O -
clear O -
of O -
the O -
ship O -
and O -
the O -
rock O -
. O -

We O -
rowed O -
, O -
by O -
my O -
computation O -
, O -
about O -
three O -
leagues O -
, O -
till O -
we O -
were O -
able O -
to O -
work O -
no O -
longer O -
, O -
being O -
already O -
spent O -
with O -
labour O -
while O -
we O -
were O -
in O -
the O -
ship O -
. O -

We O -
therefore O -
trusted O -
ourselves O -
to O -
the O -
mercy O -
of O -
the O -
waves O -
, O -
and O -
in O -
about O -
half O -
an O -
hour O -
the O -
boat O -
was O -
overset O -
by O -
a O -
sudden O -
flurry O -
from O -
the O -
north O -
. O -

What O -
became O -
of O -
my O -
companions O -
in O -
the O -
boat O -
, O -
as O -
well O -
as O -
of O -
those O -
who O -
escaped O -
on O -
the O -
rock O -
, O -
or O -
were O -
left O -
in O -
the O -
vessel O -
, O -
I O -
can O -
not O -
tell O -
; O -
but O -
conclude O -
they O -
were O -
all O -
lost O -
. O -

For O -
my O -
own O -
part O -
, O -
I O -
swam O -
as O -
fortune O -
directed O -
me O -
, O -
and O -
was O -
pushed O -
forward O -
by O -
wind O -
and O -
tide O -
. O -

I O -
often O -
let O -
my O -
legs O -
drop O -
, O -
and O -
could O -
feel O -
no O -
bottom O -
; O -
but O -
when O -
I O -
was O -
almost O -
gone O -
, O -
and O -
able O -
to O -
struggle O -
no O -
longer O -
, O -
I O -
found O -
myself O -
within O -
my O -
depth O -
; O -
and O -
by O -
this O -
time O -
the O -
storm O -
was O -
much O -
abated O -
. O -

The O -
declivity O -
was O -
so O -
small O -
, O -
that O -
I O -
walked O -
near O -
a O -
mile O -
before O -
I O -
got O -
to O -
the O -
shore O -
, O -
which O -
I O -
conjectured O -
was O -
about O -
eight O -
o’clock O -
in O -
the O -
evening O -
. O -

I O -
then O -
advanced O -
forward O -
near O -
half O -
a O -
mile O -
, O -
but O -
could O -
not O -
discover O -
any O -
sign O -
of O -
houses O -
or O -
inhabitants B-PER (62)
; O -
at O -
least O -
I O -
was O -
in O -
so O -
weak O -
a O -
condition O -
, O -
that O -
I O -
did O -
not O -
observe O -
them O -
. O -

I O -
was O -
extremely O -
tired O -
, O -
and O -
with O -
that O -
, O -
and O -
the O -
heat O -
of O -
the O -
weather O -
, O -
and O -
about O -
half O -
a O -
pint O -
of O -
brandy O -
that O -
I O -
drank O -
as O -
I O -
left O -
the O -
ship O -
, O -
I O -
found O -
myself O -
much O -
inclined O -
to O -
sleep O -
. O -

I O -
lay O -
down O -
on O -
the O -
grass O -
, O -
which O -
was O -
very O -
short O -
and O -
soft O -
, O -
where O -
I O -
slept O -
sounder O -
than O -
ever O -
I O -
remembered O -
to O -
have O -
done O -
in O -
my O -
life O -
, O -
and O -
, O -
as O -
I O -
reckoned O -
, O -
about O -
nine O -
hours O -
; O -
for O -
when O -
I O -
awaked O -
, O -
it O -
was O -
just O -
day-light O -
. O -

I O -
attempted O -
to O -
rise O -
, O -
but O -
was O -
not O -
able O -
to O -
stir O -
: O -
for O -
, O -
as O -
I O -
happened O -
to O -
lie O -
on O -
my O -
back O -
, O -
I O -
found O -
my O -
arms O -
and O -
legs O -
were O -
strongly O -
fastened O -
on O -
each O -
side O -
to O -
the O -
ground O -
; O -
and O -
my O -
hair O -
, O -
which O -
was O -
long O -
and O -
thick O -
, O -
tied O -
down O -
in O -
the O -
same O -
manner O -
. O -

I O -
likewise O -
felt O -
several O -
slender O -
ligatures O -
across O -
my O -
body O -
, O -
from O -
my O -
arm-pits O -
to O -
my O -
thighs O -
. O -

I O -
could O -
only O -
look O -
upwards O -
; O -
the O -
sun O -
began O -
to O -
grow O -
hot O -
, O -
and O -
the O -
light O -
offended O -
my O -
eyes O -
. O -

I O -
heard O -
a O -
confused O -
noise O -
about O -
me O -
; O -
but O -
in O -
the O -
posture O -
I O -
lay O -
, O -
could O -
see O -
nothing O -
except O -
the O -
sky O -
. O -

In O -
a O -
little O -
time O -
I O -
felt O -
something O -
alive O -
moving O -
on O -
my O -
left O -
leg O -
, O -
which O -
advancing O -
gently O -
forward O -
over O -
my O -
breast O -
, O -
came O -
almost O -
up O -
to O -
my O -
chin O -
; O -
when O -
, O -
bending O -
my O -
eyes O -
downwards O -
as O -
much O -
as O -
I O -
could O -
, O -
I O -
perceived O -
it O -
to O -
be O -
a B-PER (63
human I-PER -
creature I-PER -
not I-PER -
six I-PER -
inches I-PER -
high I-PER 63)
, O -
with O -
a O -
bow O -
and O -
arrow O -
in O -
his O -
hands O -
, O -
and O -
a O -
quiver O -
at O -
his O -
back O -
. O -

In O -
the O -
mean O -
time O -
, O -
I O -
felt O -
at O -
least O -
forty B-PER (64
more I-PER -
of I-PER -
the I-PER -
same I-PER -
kind I-PER 64)
( O -
as O -
I O -
conjectured O -
) O -
following O -
the O -
first O -
. O -

I O -
was O -
in O -
the O -
utmost O -
astonishment O -
, O -
and O -
roared O -
so O -
loud O -
, O -
that O -
they O -
all O -
ran O -
back O -
in O -
a O -
fright O -
; O -
and O -
some O -
of O -
them O -
, O -
as O -
I O -
was O -
afterwards O -
told O -
, O -
were O -
hurt O -
with O -
the O -
falls O -
they O -
got O -
by O -
leaping O -
from O -
my O -
sides O -
upon O -
the O -
ground O -
. O -

However O -
, O -
they O -
soon O -
returned O -
, O -
and O -
one O -
of O -
them O -
, O -
who O -
ventured O -
so O -
far O -
as O -
to O -
get O -
a O -
full O -
sight O -
of O -
my O -
face O -
, O -
lifting O -
up O -
his O -
hands O -
and O -
eyes O -
by O -
way O -
of O -
admiration O -
, O -
cried O -
out O -
in O -
a O -
shrill O -
but O -
distinct O -
voice O -
, O -
_ O -
Hekinah O -
degul O -
_ O -
: O -
the O -
others O -
repeated O -
the O -
same O -
words O -
several O -
times O -
, O -
but O -
then O -
I O -
knew O -
not O -
what O -
they O -
meant O -
. O -

I O -
lay O -
all O -
this O -
while O -
, O -
as O -
the B-PER (46
reader I-PER 46)
may O -
believe O -
, O -
in O -
great O -
uneasiness O -
. O -

At O -
length O -
, O -
struggling O -
to O -
get O -
loose O -
, O -
I O -
had O -
the O -
fortune O -
to O -
break O -
the O -
strings O -
, O -
and O -
wrench O -
out O -
the O -
pegs O -
that O -
fastened O -
my O -
left O -
arm O -
to O -
the O -
ground O -
; O -
for O -
, O -
by O -
lifting O -
it O -
up O -
to O -
my O -
face O -
, O -
I O -
discovered O -
the O -
methods O -
they O -
had O -
taken O -
to O -
bind O -
me O -
, O -
and O -
at O -
the O -
same O -
time O -
with O -
a O -
violent O -
pull O -
, O -
which O -
gave O -
me O -
excessive O -
pain O -
, O -
I O -
a O -
little O -
loosened O -
the O -
strings O -
that O -
tied O -
down O -
my O -
hair O -
on O -
the O -
left O -
side O -
, O -
so O -
that O -
I O -
was O -
just O -
able O -
to O -
turn O -
my O -
head O -
about O -
two O -
inches O -
. O -

But O -
the O -
creatures O -
ran O -
off O -
a O -
second O -
time O -
, O -
before O -
I O -
could O -
seize O -
them O -
; O -
whereupon O -
there O -
was O -
a O -
great O -
shout O -
in O -
a O -
very O -
shrill O -
accent O -
, O -
and O -
after O -
it O -
ceased O -
I O -
heard O -
one O -
of O -
them O -
cry O -
aloud O -
_ O -
Tolgo O -
phonac O -
_ O -
; O -
when O -
in O -
an O -
instant O -
I O -
felt O -
above O -
a O -
hundred O -
arrows O -
discharged O -
on O -
my O -
left O -
hand O -
, O -
which O -
, O -
pricked O -
me O -
like O -
so O -
many O -
needles O -
; O -
and O -
besides O -
, O -
they O -
shot O -
another O -
flight O -
into O -
the O -
air O -
, O -
as O -
we O -
do O -
bombs O -
in O -
Europe O -
, O -
whereof O -
many O -
, O -
I O -
suppose O -
, O -
fell O -
on O -
my O -
body O -
, O -
( O -
though O -
I O -
felt O -
them O -
not O -
) O -
, O -
and O -
some O -
on O -
my O -
face O -
, O -
which O -
I O -
immediately O -
covered O -
with O -
my O -
left O -
hand O -
. O -

When O -
this O -
shower O -
of O -
arrows O -
was O -
over O -
, O -
I O -
fell O -
a O -
groaning O -
with O -
grief O -
and O -
pain O -
; O -
and O -
then O -
striving O -
again O -
to O -
get O -
loose O -
, O -
they O -
discharged O -
another O -
volley O -
larger O -
than O -
the O -
first O -
, O -
and O -
some O -
of O -
them O -
attempted O -
with O -
spears O -
to O -
stick O -
me O -
in O -
the O -
sides O -
; O -
but O -
by O -
good O -
luck O -
I O -
had O -
on O -
a O -
buff O -
jerkin O -
, O -
which O -
they O -
could O -
not O -
pierce O -
. O -

I O -
thought O -
it O -
the O -
most O -
prudent O -
method O -
to O -
lie O -
still O -
, O -
and O -
my O -
design O -
was O -
to O -
continue O -
so O -
till O -
night O -
, O -
when O -
, O -
my O -
left O -
hand O -
being O -
already O -
loose O -
, O -
I O -
could O -
easily O -
free O -
myself O -
: O -
and O -
as O -
for O -
the B-PER (64
inhabitants I-PER 64)
, O -
I O -
had O -
reason O -
to O -
believe O -
I O -
might O -
be O -
a O -
match O -
for O -
the O -
greatest O -
army O -
they O -
could O -
bring O -
against O -
me O -
, O -
if O -
they O -
were O -
all O -
of O -
the O -
same O -
size O -
with O -
him O -
that O -
I O -
saw O -
. O -

But O -
fortune O -
disposed O -
otherwise O -
of O -
me O -
. O -

When O -
the B-PER (64
people I-PER 64)
observed O -
I O -
was O -
quiet O -
, O -
they O -
discharged O -
no O -
more O -
arrows O -
; O -
but O -
, O -
by O -
the O -
noise O -
I O -
heard O -
, O -
I O -
knew O -
their O -
numbers O -
increased O -
; O -
and O -
about O -
four O -
yards O -
from O -
me O -
, O -
over O -
against O -
my O -
right O -
ear O -
, O -
I O -
heard O -
a O -
knocking O -
for O -
above O -
an O -
hour O -
, O -
like O -
that O -
of O -
people B-PER (72)
at O -
work O -
; O -
when O -
turning O -
my O -
head O -
that O -
way O -
, O -
as O -
well O -
as O -
the O -
pegs O -
and O -
strings O -
would O -
permit O -
me O -
, O -
I O -
saw O -
a O -
stage O -
erected O -
about O -
a O -
foot O -
and O -
a O -
half O -
from O -
the O -
ground O -
, O -
capable O -
of O -
holding O -
four O -
of O -
the B-PER (64

: O -
from O -
whence O -
one O -
of O -
them O -
, O -
who O -
seemed O -
to O -
be O -
a B-PER (101
person I-PER -
of I-PER -
quality I-PER 101)
, O -
made O -
me O -
a O -
long O -
speech O -
, O -
whereof O -
I O -
understood O -
not O -
one O -
syllable O -
. O -

But O -
I O -
should O -
have O -
mentioned O -
, O -
that O -
before O -
the B-PER (73
principal I-PER -
person I-PER 73)
began O -
his O -
oration O -
, O -
he O -
cried O -
out O -
three O -
times O -
, O -
_ O -
Langro O -
dehul O -
san O -
_ O -
( O -
these O -
words O -
and O -
the O -
former O -
were O -
afterwards O -
repeated O -
and O -
explained O -
to O -
me O -
) O -
; O -
whereupon O -
, O -
immediately O -
, O -
about O -
fifty O -
of O -
the B-PER (64
inhabitants I-PER 64)|74)
came O -
and O -
cut O -
the O -
strings O -
that O -
fastened O -
the O -
left O -
side O -
of O -
my O -
head O -
, O -
which O -
gave O -
me O -
the O -
liberty O -
of O -
turning O -
it O -
to O -
the O -
right O -
, O -
and O -
of O -
observing O -
the B-PER (73
person I-PER 73)
and O -
gesture O -
of O -
him O -
that O -
was O -
to O -
speak O -
. O -

He O -
appeared O -
to O -
be O -
of O -
a O -
middle O -
age O -
, O -
and O -
taller O -
than O -
any O -
of O -
the O -
other O -
three O -
who O -
attended O -
him O -
, O -
whereof O -
one O -
was O -
a B-PER (102
page I-PER -
that I-PER -
held I-PER -
up I-PER -
his I-PER (73)
train I-PER 102)
, O -
and O -
seemed O -
to O -
be O -
somewhat O -
longer O -
than O -
my O -
middle O -
finger O -
; O -
the O -
other O -
two O -
stood O -
one O -
on O -
each O -
side O -
to O -
support O -
him O -
. O -

He O -
acted O -
every O -
part O -
of O -
an B-PER (77
orator I-PER 77)
, O -
and O -
I O -
could O -
observe O -
many O -
periods O -
of O -
threatenings O -
, O -
and O -
others O -
of O -
promises O -
, O -
pity O -
, O -
and O -
kindness O -
. O -

I O -
answered O -
in O -
a O -
few O -
words O -
, O -
but O -
in O -
the O -
most O -
submissive O -
manner O -
, O -
lifting O -
up O -
my O -
left O -
hand O -
, O -
and O -
both O -
my O -
eyes O -
to O -
the O -
sun O -
, O -
as O -
calling O -
him O -
for O -
a B-PER (78
witness I-PER 78)
; O -
and O -
being O -
almost O -
famished O -
with O -
hunger O -
, O -
having O -
not O -
eaten O -
a O -
morsel O -
for O -
some O -
hours O -
before O -
I O -
left O -
the O -
ship O -
, O -
I O -
found O -
the O -
demands O -
of O -
nature O -
so O -
strong O -
upon O -
me O -
, O -
that O -
I O -
could O -
not O -
forbear O -
showing O -
my O -
impatience O -
( O -
perhaps O -
against O -
the O -
strict O -
rules O -
of O -
decency O -
) O -
by O -
putting O -
my O -
finger O -
frequently O -
to O -
my O -
mouth O -
, O -
to O -
signify O -
that O -
I O -
wanted O -
food O -
. O -

The O -
_ O -
hurgo B-PER (73)
_ O -
( O -
for O -
so O -
they O -
call O -
a B-PER (79
great I-PER -
lord I-PER 79)
, O -
as O -
I O -
afterwards O -
learnt O -
) O -
understood O -
me O -
very O -
well O -
. O -

He O -
descended O -
from O -
the O -
stage O -
, O -
and O -
commanded O -
that O -
several O -
ladders O -
should O -
be O -
applied O -
to O -
my O -
sides O -
, O -
on O -
which O -
above O -
a O -
hundred O -
of O -
the B-PER (64
inhabitants I-PER 64)|80)
mounted O -
and O -
walked O -
towards O -
my O -
mouth O -
, O -
laden O -
with O -
baskets O -
full O -
of O -
meat O -
, O -
which O -
had O -
been O -
provided O -
and O -
sent O -
thither O -
by O -
the B-PER (81
king I-PER 81)
’s O -
orders O -
, O -
upon O -
the O -
first O -
intelligence O -
he O -
received O -
of O -
me O -
. O -

I O -
observed O -
there O -
was O -
the O -
flesh O -
of O -
several O -
animals O -
, O -
but O -
could O -
not O -
distinguish O -
them O -
by O -
the O -
taste O -
. O -

There O -
were O -
shoulders O -
, O -
legs O -
, O -
and O -
loins O -
, O -
shaped O -
like O -
those O -
of O -
mutton O -
, O -
and O -
very O -
well O -
dressed O -
, O -
but O -
smaller O -
than O -
the O -
wings O -
of O -
a O -
lark O -
. O -

I O -
ate O -
them O -
by O -
two O -
or O -
three O -
at O -
a O -
mouthful O -
, O -
and O -
took O -
three O -
loaves O -
at O -
a O -
time O -
, O -
about O -
the O -
bigness O -
of O -
musket O -
bullets O -
. O -

They O -
supplied O -
me O -
as O -
fast O -
as O -
they O -
could O -
, O -
showing O -
a O -
thousand O -
marks O -
of O -
wonder O -
and O -
astonishment O -
at O -
my O -
bulk O -
and O -
appetite O -
. O -

I O -
then O -
made O -
another O -
sign O -
, O -
that O -
I O -
wanted O -
drink O -
. O -

They O -
found O -
by O -
my O -
eating O -
that O -
a O -
small O -
quantity O -
would O -
not O -
suffice O -
me O -
; O -
and O -
being O -
a B-PER (103
most I-PER -
ingenious I-PER -
people I-PER 103)
, O -
they O -
slung O -
up O -
, O -
with O -
great O -
dexterity O -
, O -
one O -
of O -
their O -
largest O -
hogsheads O -
, O -
then O -
rolled O -
it O -
towards O -
my O -
hand O -
, O -
and O -
beat O -
out O -
the O -
top O -
; O -
I O -
drank O -
it O -
off O -
at O -
a O -
draught O -
, O -
which O -
I O -
might O -
well O -
do O -
, O -
for O -
it O -
did O -
not O -
hold O -
half O -
a O -
pint O -
, O -
and O -
tasted O -
like O -
a O -
small O -
wine O -
of O -
Burgundy O -
, O -
but O -
much O -
more O -
delicious O -
. O -

They O -
brought O -
me O -
a O -
second O -
hogshead O -
, O -
which O -
I O -
drank O -
in O -
the O -
same O -
manner O -
, O -
and O -
made O -
signs O -
for O -
more O -
; O -
but O -
they O -
had O -
none O -
to O -
give O -
me O -
. O -

When O -
I O -
had O -
performed O -
these O -
wonders O -
, O -
they O -
shouted O -
for O -
joy O -
, O -
and O -
danced O -
upon O -
my O -
breast O -
, O -
repeating O -
several O -
times O -
as O -
they O -
did O -
at O -
first O -
, O -
_ O -
Hekinah O -
degul O -
_ O -
. O -

They O -
made O -
me O -
a O -
sign O -
that O -
I O -
should O -
throw O -
down O -
the O -
two O -
hogsheads O -
, O -
but O -
first O -
warning O -
the B-PER (83
people I-PER -
below I-PER 83)
to O -
stand O -
out O -
of O -
the O -
way O -
, O -
crying O -
aloud O -
, O -
_ O -
Borach O -
mevolah O -
_ O -
; O -
and O -
when O -
they O -
saw O -
the O -
vessels O -
in O -
the O -
air O -
, O -
there O -
was O -
a O -
universal O -
shout O -
of O -
_ O -
Hekinah O -
degul O -
_ O -
. O -

I O -
confess O -
I O -
was O -
often O -
tempted O -
, O -
while O -
they O -
were O -
passing O -
backwards O -
and O -
forwards O -
on O -
my O -
body O -
, O -
to O -
seize O -
forty O -
or O -
fifty O -
of O -
the O -
first O -
that O -
came O -
in O -
my O -
reach O -
, O -
and O -
dash O -
them O -
against O -
the O -
ground O -
. O -

But O -
the O -
remembrance O -
of O -
what O -
I O -
had O -
felt O -
, O -
which O -
probably O -
might O -
not O -
be O -
the O -
worst O -
they O -
could O -
do O -
, O -
and O -
the O -
promise O -
of O -
honour O -
I O -
made O -
them O -
— O -
for O -
so O -
I O -
interpreted O -
my O -
submissive O -
behaviour O -
— O -
soon O -
drove O -
out O -
these O -
imaginations O -
. O -

Besides O -
, O -
I O -
now O -
considered O -
myself O -
as O -
bound O -
by O -
the O -
laws O -
of O -
hospitality O -
, O -
to O -
a B-PER (64
people I-PER -
who I-PER -
had I-PER -
treated I-PER -
me I-PER (1)
with I-PER -
so I-PER -
much I-PER -
expense I-PER -
and I-PER -
magnificence I-PER 64)
. O -

However O -
, O -
in O -
my O -
thoughts O -
I O -
could O -
not O -
sufficiently O -
wonder O -
at O -
the O -
intrepidity O -
of O -
these B-PER (64
diminutive I-PER -
mortals I-PER 64)
, O -
who O -
durst O -
venture O -
to O -
mount O -
and O -
walk O -
upon O -
my O -
body O -
, O -
while O -
one O -
of O -
my O -
hands O -
was O -
at O -
liberty O -
, O -
without O -
trembling O -
at O -
the O -
very O -
sight O -
of O -
so B-PER (85
prodigious I-PER -
a I-PER -
creature I-PER 85)
as O -
I O -
must O -
appear O -
to O -
them O -
. O -

After O -
some O -
time O -
, O -
when O -
they O -
observed O -
that O -
I O -
made O -
no O -
more O -
demands O -
for O -
meat O -
, O -
there O -
appeared O -
before O -
me O -
a B-PER (73
person I-PER -
of I-PER -
high I-PER -
rank I-PER -
from I-PER -
his I-PER (86)
imperial I-PER -
majesty I-PER 73)
. O -

His B-PER (73|(73)
excellency I-PER 73)
, O -
having O -
mounted O -
on O -
the O -
small O -
of O -
my O -
right O -
leg O -
, O -
advanced O -
forwards O -
up O -
to O -
my O -
face O -
, O -
with O -
about O -
a B-PER (87
dozen I-PER -
of I-PER -
his I-PER (73)
retinue I-PER 87)
; O -
and O -
producing O -
his O -
credentials O -
under O -
the O -
signet O -
royal O -
, O -
which O -
he O -
applied O -
close O -
to O -
my O -
eyes O -
, O -
spoke O -
about O -
ten O -
minutes O -
without O -
any O -
signs O -
of O -
anger O -
, O -
but O -
with O -
a O -
kind O -
of O -
determinate O -
resolution O -
, O -
often O -
pointing O -
forwards O -
, O -
which O -
, O -
as O -
I O -
afterwards O -
found O -
, O -
was O -
towards O -
the O -
capital O -
city O -
, O -
about O -
half O -
a O -
mile O -
distant O -
; O -
whither O -
it O -
was O -
agreed O -
by O -
his O -
majesty O -
in O -
council O -
that O -
I O -
must O -
be O -
conveyed O -
. O -

I O -
answered O -
in O -
few O -
words O -
, O -
but O -
to O -
no O -
purpose O -
, O -
and O -
made O -
a O -
sign O -
with O -
my O -
hand O -
that O -
was O -
loose O -
, O -
putting O -
it O -
to O -
the O -
other O -
( O -
but O -
over O -
his B-PER (73|(73)
excellency I-PER 73)
’s O -
head O -
for O -
fear O -
of O -
hurting O -
him O -
or O -
his O -
train O -
) O -
and O -
then O -
to O -
my O -
own O -
head O -
and O -
body O -
, O -
to O -
signify O -
that O -
I O -
desired O -
my O -
liberty O -
. O -

It O -
appeared O -
that O -
he O -
understood O -
me O -
well O -
enough O -
, O -
for O -
he O -
shook O -
his O -
head O -
by O -
way O -
of O -
disapprobation O -
, O -
and O -
held O -
his O -
hand O -
in O -
a O -
posture O -
to O -
show O -
that O -
I O -
must O -
be O -
carried O -
as O -
a B-PER (89
prisoner I-PER 89)
. O -

However O -
, O -
he O -
made O -
other O -
signs O -
to O -
let O -
me O -
understand O -
that O -
I O -
should O -
have O -
meat O -
and O -
drink O -
enough O -
, O -
and O -
very O -
good O -
treatment O -
. O -

Whereupon O -
I O -
once O -
more O -
thought O -
of O -
attempting O -
to O -
break O -
my O -
bonds O -
; O -
but O -
again O -
, O -
when O -
I O -
felt O -
the O -
smart O -
of O -
their O -
arrows O -
upon O -
my O -
face O -
and O -
hands O -
, O -
which O -
were O -
all O -
in O -
blisters O -
, O -
and O -
many O -
of O -
the O -
darts O -
still O -
sticking O -
in O -
them O -
, O -
and O -
observing O -
likewise O -
that O -
the O -
number O -
of O -
my B-PER (64|(1)
enemies I-PER 64)
increased O -
, O -
I O -
gave O -
tokens O -
to O -
let O -
them O -
know O -
that O -
they O -
might O -
do O -
with O -
me O -
what O -
they O -
pleased O -
. O -

Upon O -
this O -
, O -
the O -
_ O -
hurgo O -
_ O -
and O -
his O -
train O -
withdrew O -
, O -
with O -
much O -
civility O -
and O -
cheerful O -
countenances O -
. O -

Soon O -
after O -
I O -
heard O -
a B-PER (90
general I-PER 90)
shout O -
, O -
with O -
frequent O -
repetitions O -
of O -
the O -
words O -
_ O -
Peplom O -
selan O -
_ O -
; O -
and O -
I O -
felt O -
great B-PER (91
numbers I-PER -
of I-PER -
people I-PER -
on I-PER -
my I-PER (1)
left I-PER -
side I-PER 91)
relaxing O -
the O -
cords O -
to O -
such O -
a O -
degree O -
, O -
that O -
I O -
was O -
able O -
to O -
turn O -
upon O -
my O -
right O -
, O -
and O -
to O -
ease O -
myself O -
with O -
making O -
water O -
; O -
which O -
I O -
very O -
plentifully O -
did O -
, O -
to O -
the O -
great O -
astonishment O -
of O -
the B-PER (91
people I-PER 91)
; O -
who O -
, O -
conjecturing O -
by O -
my O -
motion O -
what O -
I O -
was O -
going O -
to O -
do O -
, O -
immediately O -
opened O -
to O -
the O -
right O -
and O -
left O -
on O -
that O -
side O -
, O -
to O -
avoid O -
the O -
torrent O -
, O -
which O -
fell O -
with O -
such O -
noise O -
and O -
violence O -
from O -
me O -
. O -

But O -
before O -
this O -
, O -
they O -
had O -
daubed O -
my O -
face O -
and O -
both O -
my O -
hands O -
with O -
a O -
sort O -
of O -
ointment O -
, O -
very O -
pleasant O -
to O -
the O -
smell O -
, O -
which O -
, O -
in O -
a O -
few O -
minutes O -
, O -
removed O -
all O -
the O -
smart O -
of O -
their O -
arrows O -
. O -

These O -
circumstances O -
, O -
added O -
to O -
the O -
refreshment O -
I O -
had O -
received O -
by O -
their O -
victuals O -
and O -
drink O -
, O -
which O -
were O -
very O -
nourishing O -
, O -
disposed O -
me O -
to O -
sleep O -
. O -

I O -
slept O -
about O -
eight O -
hours O -
, O -
as O -
I O -
was O -
afterwards O -
assured O -
; O -
and O -
it O -
was O -
no O -
wonder O -
, O -
for O -
the B-PER (92

the B-PER (81

the B-PER (5

Durbeyfield B-PER (1)

a O -
few O -

in O -
a O -

then O -
sat O -
down O -

In O -

The O -

up O -

TO O -
Mrs. B-PER (1

England O -
You O -
will O -
rejoice O -
to O -
hear O -
that O -
no O -
disaster O -
has O -
accompanied O -
the O -
commencement O -
of O -
an O -
enterprise O -
which O -
you O -
have O -
regarded O -
with O -
such O -
evil O -
forebodings O -
. O -

I O -
arrived O -
here O -
yesterday O -
, O -
and O -
my O -
first O -
task O -
is O -
to O -
assure O -
my B-PER (1|(3)
dear I-PER -
sister I-PER 1)
of O -
my O -
welfare O -
and O -
increasing O -
confidence O -
in O -
the O -
success O -
of O -
my O -
undertaking O -
. O -

I O -
am O -
already O -
far O -
north O -
of O -
London O -
, O -
and O -
as O -
I O -
walk O -
in O -
the O -
streets O -
of O -
Petersburgh O -
, O -
I O -
feel O -
a O -
cold O -
northern O -
breeze O -
play O -
upon O -
my O -
cheeks O -
, O -
which O -
braces O -
my O -
nerves O -
and O -
fills O -
me O -
with O -
delight O -
. O -

Do O -
you O -
understand O -
this O -
feeling O -
? O -

This O -
breeze O -
, O -
which O -
has O -
travelled O -
from O -
the O -
regions O -
towards O -
which O -
I O -
am O -
advancing O -
, O -
gives O -
me O -
a O -
foretaste O -
of O -
those O -
icy O -
climes O -
. O -

Inspirited O -
by O -
this O -
wind O -
of O -
promise O -
, O -
my O -
daydreams O -
become O -
more O -
fervent O -
and O -
vivid O -
. O -

I O -
try O -
in O -
vain O -
to O -
be O -
persuaded O -
that O -
the O -
pole O -
is O -
the O -
seat O -
of O -
frost O -
and O -
desolation O -
; O -
it O -
ever O -
presents O -
itself O -
to O -
my O -
imagination O -
as O -
the O -
region O -
of O -
beauty O -
and O -
delight O -
. O -

There O -
, O -
Margaret B-PER (1)
, O -
the O -
sun O -
is O -
forever O -
visible O -
, O -
its O -
broad O -
disk O -
just O -
skirting O -
the O -

and O -
diffusing O -
a O -
perpetual O -
splendour O -

There O -
-- O -
for O -
with O -
your O -
leave O -
, O -
my B-PER (1|(3)
sister I-PER 1)
, O -
I O -
will O -
put O -
some O -
trust O -
in O -
preceding B-PER (9

-- O -
there O -
snow O -
and O -
frost O -
are O -
banished O -
; O -
and O -
, O -
sailing O -
over O -
a O -
calm O -
sea O -
, O -
we O -
may O -
be O -
wafted O -
to O -
a O -
land O -
surpassing O -
in O -
wonders O -
and O -
in O -
beauty O -
every O -
region O -
hitherto O -
discovered O -
on O -
the O -
habitable O -
globe O -
. O -

Its O -
productions O -
and O -
features O -
may O -
be O -
without O -
example O -
, O -
as O -
the O -
phenomena O -
of O -
the O -
heavenly O -
bodies O -
undoubtedly O -
are O -
in O -
those O -
undiscovered O -
solitudes O -
. O -

What O -
may O -
not O -
be O -
expected O -
in O -
a O -
country O -
of O -
eternal O -
light O -
? O -

I O -
may O -
there O -
discover O -
the O -
wondrous O -
power O -
which O -
attracts O -
the O -
needle O -
and O -
may O -
regulate O -
a O -
thousand O -
celestial O -
observations O -
that O -
require O -
only O -
this O -
voyage O -
to O -
render O -
their O -
seeming O -
eccentricities O -
consistent O -
forever O -
. O -

I O -
shall O -
satiate O -
my O -
ardent O -
curiosity O -
with O -
the O -
sight O -
of O -
a O -
part O -
of O -
the O -
world O -
never O -
before O -
visited O -
, O -
and O -
may O -
tread O -
a O -
land O -
never O -
before O -
imprinted O -
by O -
the O -
foot O -
of O -
man B-PER (15)|7)
. O -

These O -
are O -
my O -
enticements O -
, O -
and O -
they O -
are O -
sufficient O -
to O -
conquer O -
all O -
fear O -
of O -
danger O -
or O -
death O -
and O -
to O -
induce O -
me O -
to O -
commence O -
this O -
laborious O -
voyage O -
with O -
the O -
joy O -
a B-PER (16
child I-PER 16)
feels O -
when O -
he O -
embarks O -
in O -
a O -
little O -
boat O -
, O -
with O -
his B-PER (18|(16)

, O -
on O -
an O -
expedition O -
of O -
discovery O -
up O -
his O -
native O -
river O -
. O -

But O -
supposing O -
all O -
these O -
conjectures O -
to O -
be O -
false O -
, O -
you O -
can O -
not O -
contest O -
the O -
inestimable O -
benefit O -
which O -
I O -
shall O -
confer O -
on O -
all O -
mankind B-PER (15)
, O -
to O -
the B-PER (20

, O -
by O -

a O -

near O -

can O -
only O -
be O -

These O -
reflections O -
have O -
dispelled O -
the O -
agitation O -
with O -
which O -
I O -
began O -
my O -
letter O -
, O -
and O -
I O -

my O -

glow O -
with O -
an O -
enthusiasm O -
which O -
elevates O -
me O -

much O -
to O -
tranquillize O -
the O -

This O -

has O -

My O -
education O -
was O -
neglected O -
, O -
yet O -
I O -
was O -
passionately O -
fond O -
of O -
reading O -
. O -

These O -
volumes O -
were O -
my O -
study O -
day O -
and O -
night O -
, O -
and O -
my O -
familiarity O -
with O -
them O -
increased O -
that O -
regret O -
which O -
I O -
had O -
felt O -
, O -
as O -
a B-PER (3
child I-PER 3)
, O -
on O -
learning O -
that O -
my B-PER (27|(3)
father I-PER 27)

dying O -

had O -
forbidden O -
my B-PER (24|(3)
uncle I-PER 24)
to O -
allow O -
me O -
to O -
embark O -
in O -
a O -
seafaring O -
life O -

These O -
visions O -
faded O -
when O -
I O -
perused O -
, O -
for O -
the O -
first O -
time O -
, O -
those O -
poets O -
whose O -
effusions O -
entranced O -
my B-PER (3)
soul I-PER 28)
and O -
lifted O -
it O -
to O -
heaven O -
. O -

I O -
also O -
became O -
a B-PER (79
poet I-PER 79)
and O -
for O -
one O -
year O -
lived O -
in O -
a O -
paradise O -
of O -
my O -
own O -
creation O -
; O -
I O -
imagined O -
that O -
I O -
also O -
might O -
obtain O -
a O -
niche O -
in O -
the O -
temple O -
where O -
the O -
names O -
of O -
Homer B-PER (29)

are O -
consecrated O -

You O -
are O -
well O -
acquainted O -
with O -
my O -
failure O -
and O -
how O -
heavily O -
I O -
bore O -
the O -
disappointment O -
. O -

But O -
just O -
at O -
that O -
time O -
I O -
inherited O -
the O -
fortune O -
of O -
my B-PER (31|(3)
cousin I-PER 31)
, O -
and O -
my O -
thoughts O -
were O -
turned O -
into O -
the O -
channel O -
of O -
their O -
earlier O -

. O -

Six O -
years O -
have O -
passed O -
since O -
I O -
resolved O -
on O -
my O -
present O -
undertaking O -
. O -

I O -
can O -
, O -
even O -
now O -
, O -
remember O -
the O -
hour O -
from O -
which O -
I O -
dedicated O -
myself O -
to O -
this O -
great O -
enterprise O -
. O -

I O -
commenced O -
by O -
inuring O -
my B-PER (3|(3)
body I-PER 3)
to O -
hardship O -
. O -

I O -
accompanied O -
the B-PER (32
whale-fishers I-PER 32)
on O -
several O -
expeditions O -
to O -
the O -
North O -
Sea O -
; O -
I O -
voluntarily O -
endured O -
cold O -
, O -
famine O -
, O -
thirst O -
, O -
and O -
want O -
of O -
sleep O -
; O -
I O -
often O -
worked O -
harder O -
than O -
the B-PER (33
common I-PER -
sailors I-PER 33)
during O -
the O -
day O -
and O -
devoted O -
my O -
nights O -
to O -
the O -
study O -
of O -
mathematics O -
, O -
the O -
theory O -
of O -
medicine O -
, O -
and O -
those O -
branches O -
of O -
physical O -
science O -
from O -
which O -
a B-PER (34
naval I-PER -
adventurer I-PER 34)
might O -
derive O -
the O -
greatest O -
practical O -
advantage O -
. O -

Twice O -
I O -
actually O -
hired O -
myself O -
as O -
an O -
under-mate O -
in O -
a O -
Greenland O -
whaler O -
, O -
and O -
acquitted O -
myself O -
to O -
admiration O -
. O -

I O -
must O -
own O -
I O -
felt O -
a O -
little O -
proud O -
when O -
my B-PER (36|(3)
captain I-PER 36)
offered O -
me O -
the O -
second O -
dignity O -
in O -
the O -
vessel O -
and O -
entreated O -
me O -
to O -
remain O -
with O -
the O -
greatest O -
earnestness O -
, O -
so O -
valuable O -
did O -
he O -
consider O -
my O -
services O -
. O -

And O -
now O -
, O -
dear O -
Margaret B-PER (1)
, O -
do O -
I O -
not O -
deserve O -
to O -
accomplish O -
some O -
great O -
purpose O -
? O -

My O -
life O -
might O -
have O -
been O -
passed O -
in O -
ease O -
and O -
luxury O -
, O -
but O -
I O -
preferred O -
glory O -
to O -
every O -
enticement O -
that O -
wealth O -
placed O -
in O -
my O -
path O -
. O -

Oh O -
, O -
that O -
some O -
encouraging O -
voice O -
would O -
answer O -
in O -
the O -
affirmative O -
! O -

My O -
courage O -
and O -
my O -
resolution O -
is O -
firm O -
; O -
but O -
my O -
hopes O -
fluctuate O -
, O -
and O -
my O -
spirits O -
are O -
often O -
depressed O -
. O -

I O -
am O -
about O -
to O -
proceed O -
on O -
a O -
long O -
and O -
difficult O -
voyage O -
, O -
the O -
emergencies O -
of O -
which O -
will O -
demand O -
all O -
my O -
fortitude O -
: O -
I O -
am O -
required O -
not O -
only O -
to O -
raise O -
the O -
spirits O -
of O -
others O -
, O -
but O -
sometimes O -
to O -
sustain O -
my O -
own O -
, O -
when O -
theirs O -
are O -
failing O -
. O -

This O -
is O -
the O -
most O -
favourable O -
period O -
for O -
travelling O -
in O -
Russia O -
. O -

They O -
fly O -
quickly O -
over O -
the O -
snow O -
in O -
their O -
sledges O -
; O -
the O -
motion O -
is O -
pleasant O -
, O -
and O -
, O -
in O -
my O -
opinion O -
, O -
far O -
more O -
agreeable O -
than O -
that O -
of O -
an O -
English O -
stagecoach O -
. O -

The O -
cold O -
is O -
not O -
excessive O -
, O -
if O -
you O -
are O -
wrapped O -
in O -
furs O -
-- O -
a O -
dress O -
which O -
I O -
have O -
already O -
adopted O -
, O -
for O -
there O -
is O -
a O -
great O -
difference O -
between O -
walking O -
the O -
deck O -
and O -
remaining O -
seated O -
motionless O -
for O -
hours O -
, O -
when O -
no O -
exercise O -
prevents O -
the O -
blood O -
from O -
actually O -
freezing O -
in O -
your O -
veins O -
. O -

I O -
have O -
no O -
ambition O -
to O -
lose O -
my O -
life O -
on O -
the O -
post-road O -
between O -
St. O -
Petersburgh O -
and O -
Archangel O -
. O -

I O -
shall O -
depart O -
for O -
the O -
latter O -
town O -
in O -
a O -
fortnight O -
or O -
three O -
weeks O -
; O -
and O -
my O -
intention O -
is O -
to O -
hire O -
a O -
ship O -
there O -
, O -
which O -
can O -
easily O -
be O -
done O -
by O -
paying O -
the O -
insurance O -
for O -
the B-PER (45
owner I-PER 45)
, O -
and O -
to O -
engage O -
as O -
many O -
sailors B-PER (46)
as O -
I O -
think O -
necessary O -
among O -
those B-PER (47
who I-PER -
are I-PER -
accustomed I-PER -
to I-PER -
the I-PER -
whale-fishing I-PER 47)
. O -

I O -
do O -
not O -
intend O -
to O -
sail O -
until O -
the O -
month O -
of O -
June O -
; O -
and O -
when O -
shall O -
I O -
return O -
? O -

Ah O -
, O -
dear O -
sister B-PER (1)
, O -
how O -
can O -
I O -
answer O -
this O -
question O -
? O -

If O -
I O -
succeed O -
, O -
many O -
, O -
many O -
months O -
, O -
perhaps O -
years O -
, O -
will O -
pass O -
before O -
you O -
and O -
I O -
may O -
meet O -

If O -
I O -
fail O -
, O -
you O -
will O -
see O -
me O -
again O -
soon O -

never O -

How O -

the O -

passes O -

encompassed O -

I O -
am O -
by O -
frost O -

Yet O -
a O -
second O -
step O -
is O -
taken O -
towards O -
my O -
enterprise O -
. O -

I O -
have O -
hired O -
a O -
vessel O -
and O -
am O -
occupied O -
in O -
collecting O -
my B-PER (49|(3)

those O -
whom O -
I O -

men B-PER (50

and O -
are O -
certainly O -
possessed O -
of O -
dauntless O -
courage O -

But O -
I O -
have O -
one O -
want O -
which O -
I O -
have O -
never O -
yet O -
been O -
able O -
to O -
satisfy O -

and O -
the O -
absence O -
of O -

I O -
now O -

most O -

: O -
when O -
I O -
am O -

there O -
will O -
be O -

if O -
I O -

assailed O -
by O -

no B-PER (51

will O -
endeavour O -
to O -
sustain O -
me O -
in O -
dejection O -

I O -
shall O -
commit O -
my O -
thoughts O -
to O -
paper O -
, O -
it O -
is O -
true O -
; O -
but O -
that O -
is O -
a O -
poor O -
medium O -
for O -
the O -
communication O -
of O -
feeling O -
. O -

I O -
desire O -
the O -
company O -
of O -
a B-PER (52

could I-PER -
sympathize I-PER -
with I-PER -
me I-PER 52)|(3)
, O -
whose O -
eyes O -
would O -
reply O -
to O -
mine O -

You O -
may O -
deem O -
me O -
romantic O -
, O -
my B-PER (1|(3)
dear I-PER -
sister I-PER 1)
, O -
but O -
I O -
bitterly O -
feel O -
the O -
want O -
of O -
a B-PER (53
friend I-PER 53)
. O -

I O -
have O -
no B-PER (54
one I-PER 54)
near O -
me O -
, O -
gentle O -

courageous O -
, O -
possessed O -

are O -
like O -
my O -

to O -

How O -
would O -
such O -
a B-PER (55

repair O -
the O -
faults O -
of O -
your B-PER (3|(1)
poor I-PER -

! O -

I O -
am O -
too O -
ardent O -
in O -
execution O -
and O -
too O -
impatient O -
of O -
difficulties O -
. O -

But O -
it O -
is O -
a O -
still O -
greater O -
evil O -
to O -
me O -
that O -
I O -
am O -
self-educated O -
: O -
for O -
the O -
first O -
fourteen O -
years O -
of O -
my O -
life O -
I O -
ran O -
wild O -
on O -
a O -
common O -

read O -

At O -
that O -
age O -
I O -
became O -
acquainted O -
with O -
the O -
celebrated O -
poets O -
of O -
our O -
own O -
country O -
; O -
but O -
it O -
was O -
only O -
when O -
it O -
had O -
ceased O -
to O -
be O -
in O -
my O -
power O -
to O -
derive O -
its O -
most O -
important O -
benefits O -
from O -
such O -
a O -
conviction O -
that O -
I O -
perceived O -
the O -
necessity O -
of O -
becoming O -
acquainted O -
with O -
more O -
languages O -
than O -
that O -
of O -
my O -
native O -
country O -
. O -

Now O -
I O -
am O -
twenty-eight O -
and O -
am O -
in O -
reality O -
more O -
illiterate O -
than O -
many B-PER (57

It O -
is O -
true O -
that O -
I O -
have O -
thought O -
more O -
and O -
that O -
my O -
daydreams O -
are O -
more O -
extended O -
and O -
magnificent O -
, O -
but O -
they O -
want O -

the B-PER (58

KEEPING O -
; O -
and O -
I O -
greatly O -
need O -
a B-PER (59

would I-PER -
have I-PER -
sense I-PER -
enough I-PER -

to I-PER -

me I-PER (3)
as I-PER -
romantic I-PER -

affection I-PER -

me I-PER (3)
to I-PER -

to I-PER -

my I-PER (3)
mind I-PER 59)
. O -

Well O -
, O -
these O -
are O -
useless O -
complaints O -
; O -
I O -
shall O -
certainly O -
find O -
no B-PER (60

circumstance O -

added O -
to O -
his O -
well-known O -

very O -
desirous O -

A O -
youth O -
passed O -

my O -

your O -

overcome O -
an O -
intense O -

I O -
have O -
never O -
believed O -
it O -
to O -

necessary O -

and O -
when O -
I O -
heard O -
of O -
a B-PER (67

equally O -
noted O -
for O -
his O -
kindliness O -
of O -
heart O -

the O -

obedience O -
paid O -
to O -

I O -
felt O -
myself O -
peculiarly O -
fortunate O -
in O -
being O -
able O -
to O -
secure O -
his O -
services O -

I O -
heard O -
of O -
him O -
first O -
in O -
rather O -
a O -
romantic O -
manner O -
, O -
from O -
a B-PER (70

He O -

before O -

the B-PER (72

CHAPTER O -
I O -
It O -
was O -
a O -
Sunday O -
evening O -
in O -
October O -
, O -
and O -
in O -
common O -
with O -
many B-PER (0
other I-PER -
young I-PER -
ladies I-PER -
of I-PER -
her I-PER (1)
class I-PER 0)
, O -
Katharine B-PER (1
Hilbery I-PER 1)
was O -
pouring O -
out O -
tea O -
. O -

Perhaps O -
a O -
fifth O -
part O -
of O -
her O -
mind O -
was O -
thus O -
occupied O -
, O -
and O -
the O -
remaining O -
parts O -
leapt O -
over O -
the O -
little O -
barrier O -
of O -
day O -
which O -
interposed O -
between O -
Monday O -
morning O -
and O -
this O -
rather O -
subdued O -
moment O -
, O -
and O -
played O -
with O -
the O -
things O -
one O -
does O -
voluntarily O -
and O -
normally O -
in O -
the O -
daylight O -
. O -

But O -
although O -
she O -
was O -
silent O -
, O -
she O -
was O -
evidently O -
mistress B-PER (61)
of O -
a O -
situation O -
which O -
was O -
familiar O -
enough O -
to O -
her O -
, O -
and O -
inclined O -
to O -
let O -
it O -
take O -
its O -
way O -
for O -
the O -
six O -
hundredth O -
time O -
, O -
perhaps O -
, O -
without O -
bringing O -
into O -
play O -
any O -
of O -
her O -
unoccupied O -
faculties O -
. O -

A O -
single O -
glance O -
was O -
enough O -
to O -
show O -
that O -
Mrs. B-PER (2
Hilbery O -
was O -
so O -
rich O -
in O -
the O -
gifts O -
which O -
make O -
tea-parties O -
of O -
elderly B-PER (3
distinguished I-PER -
people I-PER 3)
successful O -
, O -
that O -
she O -
scarcely O -
needed O -
any O -
help O -
from O -
her B-PER (1|(2)
daughter I-PER 1)
, O -
provided O -
that O -
the O -
tiresome O -
business O -
of O -
teacups O -
and O -
bread O -
and O -
butter O -
was O -
discharged O -
for O -
her O -
. O -

Considering O -
that O -
the B-PER (4
little I-PER -
party I-PER 4)
had O -
been O -
seated O -
round O -
the O -
tea-table O -
for O -
less O -
than O -
twenty O -
minutes O -
, O -
the O -
animation O -
observable O -
on O -
their O -
faces O -
, O -
and O -
the O -
amount O -
of O -
sound O -
they O -
were O -
producing O -
collectively O -
, O -
were O -
very O -
creditable O -
to O -
the B-PER (2
hostess I-PER 2)
. O -

It O -
suddenly O -
came O -
into O -
Katharine B-PER (1)
’s O -
mind O -
that O -
if O -
some B-PER (5
one I-PER 5)
opened O -
the O -
door O -
at O -
this O -
moment O -
he O -
would O -
think O -
that O -
they O -
were O -
enjoying O -
themselves O -
; O -
he O -
would O -
think O -
, O -
“ O -
What O -
an O -
extremely O -
nice O -
house O -
to O -
come O -
into O -
! O -
” O -

and O -
instinctively O -
she O -
laughed O -
, O -
and O -
said O -
something O -
to O -
increase O -
the O -
noise O -
, O -
for O -
the O -
credit O -
of O -
the O -
house O -
presumably O -
, O -
since O -
she O -
herself O -
had O -
not O -
been O -
feeling O -
exhilarated O -
. O -

At O -
the O -
very O -
same O -
moment O -
, O -
rather O -
to O -
her O -
amusement O -
, O -
the O -
door O -
was O -
flung O -
open O -
, O -
and O -
a B-PER (7
young I-PER -
man I-PER 7)
entered O -
the O -
room O -
. O -

Katharine B-PER (1)
, O -
as O -
she O -
shook O -
hands O -
with O -
him O -
, O -
asked O -
him O -
, O -
in O -
her O -
own O -
mind O -
, O -
“ O -
Now O -
, O -
do O -
you O -
think O -
we O -
’re O -
enjoying O -
ourselves O -
enormously O -
? O -
” O -

... O -
“ O -
Mr. B-PER (7
Denham O -
, O -
mother B-PER (2)
, O -
” O -
she O -
said O -
aloud O -
, O -
for O -
she O -
saw O -
that O -
her B-PER (2|(1)
mother I-PER 2)
had O -
forgotten O -
his O -
name O -
. O -

That O -
fact O -
was O -
perceptible O -
to O -
Mr. B-PER (7
Denham O -
also O -
, O -
and O -
increased O -
the O -
awkwardness O -
which O -
inevitably O -
attends O -
the O -
entrance O -
of O -
a B-PER (9
stranger I-PER 9)
into O -
a O -
room O -
full O -
of O -
people B-PER (11
much I-PER -
at I-PER -
their I-PER (11)
ease I-PER -
, I-PER -
and I-PER -
all I-PER -
launched I-PER -
upon I-PER -
sentences I-PER 10)|11)
. O -

At O -
the O -
same O -
time O -
, O -
it O -
seemed O -
to O -
Mr. B-PER (7
Denham O -
as O -
if O -
a O -
thousand O -
softly O -
padded O -
doors O -
had O -
closed O -
between O -
him O -
and O -
the O -
street O -
outside O -
. O -

A O -
fine O -
mist O -
, O -
the O -
etherealized O -
essence O -
of O -
the O -
fog O -
, O -
hung O -
visibly O -
in O -
the O -
wide O -
and O -
rather O -
empty O -
space O -
of O -
the O -
drawing-room O -
, O -
all O -
silver O -
where O -
the O -
candles O -
were O -
grouped O -
on O -
the O -
tea-table O -
, O -
and O -
ruddy O -
again O -
in O -
the O -
firelight O -
. O -

With O -
the O -
omnibuses O -
and O -
cabs O -
still O -
running O -
in O -
his O -
head O -
, O -
and O -
his O -
body O -
still O -
tingling O -
with O -
his O -
quick O -
walk O -
along O -
the O -
streets O -
and O -
in O -
and O -
out O -
of O -
traffic O -
and O -
foot-passengers B-PER (16)
, O -
this O -
drawing-room O -
seemed O -
very O -
remote O -
and O -
still O -
; O -
and O -
the O -
faces O -
of O -
the B-PER (17
elderly I-PER -
people I-PER 17)
were O -
mellowed O -
, O -
at O -
some O -
distance O -
from O -
each O -
other O -
, O -
and O -
had O -
a O -
bloom O -
on O -
them O -
owing O -
to O -
the O -
fact O -
that O -
the O -
air O -
in O -
the O -
drawing-room O -
was O -
thickened O -
by O -
blue O -
grains O -
of O -
mist O -
. O -

Mr. B-PER (7
Denham O -
had O -
come O -
in O -
as O -
Mr. B-PER (18
Fortescue O -
, O -
the B-PER (60
eminent I-PER -
novelist I-PER 60)
, O -
reached O -
the O -
middle O -
of O -
a O -
very O -
long O -
sentence O -
. O -

He O -
kept O -
this O -
suspended O -
while O -
the B-PER (7
newcomer I-PER 7)
sat O -
down O -
, O -
and O -
Mrs. B-PER (2
Hilbery O -
deftly O -
joined O -
the O -
severed O -
parts O -
by O -
leaning O -
towards O -
him O -
and O -
remarking O -
: O -
“ O -
Now O -
, O -
what O -
would O -
you O -
do O -
if O -
you O -
were O -
married O -
to O -
an B-PER (19
engineer I-PER 19)
, O -
and O -
had O -
to O -
live O -
in O -
Manchester O -
, O -
Mr. B-PER (7
Denham O -
? O -
” O -

“ O -
Surely O -
she O -
could O -
learn O -
Persian O -
, O -
” O -
broke O -
in O -
a B-PER (22
thin I-PER -
, I-PER -
elderly I-PER -
gentleman I-PER 22)
. O -

“ O -
Is O -
there O -
no O -
retired B-PER -
schoolmaster I-PER -
or O -
man B-PER -
of I-PER -
letters I-PER -
in O -
Manchester O -
with O -
whom O -
she O -
could O -
read O -
Persian O -
? O -
” O -

“ O -
A B-PER (21
cousin I-PER -
of I-PER -
ours I-PER 21)
has O -
married O -
and O -
gone O -
to O -
live O -
in O -
Manchester O -
, O -
” O -
Katharine B-PER (1)
explained O -
. O -

Mr. B-PER (7
Denham O -
muttered O -
something O -
, O -
which O -
was O -
indeed O -
all O -
that O -
was O -
required O -
of O -
him O -
, O -
and O -
the B-PER (18
novelist I-PER 18)
went O -
on O -
where O -
he O -
had O -
left O -
off O -
. O -

Privately O -
, O -
Mr. B-PER (7
Denham O -
cursed O -
himself O -
very O -
sharply O -
for O -
having O -
exchanged O -
the O -
freedom O -
of O -
the O -
street O -
for O -
this O -
sophisticated O -
drawing-room O -
, O -
where O -
, O -
among O -
other B-PER (4
disagreeables I-PER 4)
, O -
he O -
certainly O -
would O -
not O -
appear O -
at O -
his O -
best O -
. O -

He O -
glanced O -
round O -
him O -
, O -
and O -
saw O -
that O -
, O -
save O -
for O -
Katharine B-PER (1)
, O -
they O -
were O -
all O -
over O -
forty O -
, O -
the O -
only O -
consolation O -
being O -
that O -
Mr. B-PER (18
Fortescue O -
was O -
a B-PER (62
considerable I-PER -
celebrity I-PER 62)
, O -
so O -
that O -
to-morrow O -
one O -
might O -
be O -
glad O -
to O -
have O -
met O -
him O -
. O -

“ O -
Have O -
you O -
ever O -
been O -
to O -
Manchester O -
? O -
” O -

he O -
asked O -
Katharine B-PER (1)
. O -

“ O -
Never O -
, O -
” O -
she O -
replied O -
. O -

“ O -
Why O -
do O -
you O -
object O -
to O -
it O -
, O -
then O -
? O -
” O -

Katharine B-PER (1)
stirred O -
her O -
tea O -
, O -
and O -
seemed O -
to O -
speculate O -
, O -
so O -
Denham B-PER (7)
thought O -
, O -
upon O -
the O -
duty O -
of O -
filling O -
somebody B-PER (23
else I-PER 23)
’s O -
cup O -
, O -
but O -
she O -
was O -
really O -
wondering O -
how O -
she O -
was O -
going O -
to O -
keep O -
this B-PER (7
strange I-PER -
young I-PER -
man I-PER 7)
in O -
harmony O -
with O -
the B-PER (17
rest I-PER 17)
. O -

She O -
observed O -
that O -
he O -
was O -
compressing O -
his O -
teacup O -
, O -
so O -
that O -
there O -
was O -
danger O -
lest O -
the O -
thin O -
china O -
might O -
cave O -
inwards O -
. O -

She O -
could O -
see O -
that O -
he O -
was O -
nervous O -
; O -
one O -
would O -
expect O -
a B-PER (7
bony I-PER -
young I-PER -
man I-PER 7)
with O -
his O -
face O -
slightly O -
reddened O -
by O -
the O -
wind O -
, O -
and O -
his O -
hair O -
not O -
altogether O -
smooth O -
, O -
to O -
be O -
nervous O -
in O -
such O -
a O -
party O -
. O -

Further O -
, O -
he O -
probably O -
disliked O -
this O -
kind O -
of O -
thing O -
, O -
and O -
had O -
come O -
out O -
of O -
curiosity O -
, O -
or O -
because O -
her B-PER (24|(1)
father I-PER 24)
had O -
invited O -
him O -
-- O -
anyhow O -
, O -
he O -
would O -
not O -
be O -
easily O -
combined O -
with O -
the B-PER (17
rest I-PER 17)
. O -

“ O -
I O -
should O -
think O -
there O -
would O -
be O -
no B-PER (25
one I-PER 25)
to O -
talk O -
to O -
in O -
Manchester O -
, O -
” O -
she O -
replied O -
at O -
random O -
. O -

Mr. B-PER (18
Fortescue O -
had O -
been O -
observing O -
her O -
for O -
a O -
moment O -
or O -
two O -
, O -
as O -
novelists B-PER (26)
are O -
inclined O -
to O -
observe O -
, O -
and O -
at O -
this O -
remark O -
he O -
smiled O -
, O -
and O -
made O -
it O -
the O -
text O -
for O -
a O -
little O -
further O -
speculation O -
. O -

“ O -
In O -

of O -

decidedly O -

he O -
said O -

and O -
lying O -
back O -
in O -
his O -
chair O -
, O -
with O -
his O -
opaque O -
contemplative O -

fixed O -
on O -

the O -

” O -
said O -
Katharine B-PER (1)
. O -

“ O -
I O -
am O -
grieved O -
and O -
amazed O -
at O -
the O -
ignorance O -
of O -
my B-PER (41|(24)
family I-PER 41)
, O -
” O -
Mr. B-PER (24
Hilbery O -
remarked O -
. O -

He O -
was O -
an B-PER (63
elderly I-PER -
man I-PER 63)
, O -
with O -
a O -
pair O -
of O -
oval O -
, O -
hazel O -
eyes O -
which O -
were O -
rather O -
bright O -
for O -
his O -
time O -
of O -
life O -
, O -
and O -
relieved O -
the O -
heaviness O -
of O -
his O -
face O -
. O -

He O -
played O -
constantly O -
with O -
a O -
little O -
green O -
stone O -
attached O -
to O -
his O -
watch-chain O -
, O -
thus O -
displaying O -
long O -
and O -
very O -
sensitive O -
fingers O -
, O -
and O -
had O -
a O -
habit O -
of O -
moving O -
his O -
head O -
hither O -
and O -
thither O -
very O -
quickly O -
without O -
altering O -
the O -
position O -
of O -
his O -
large O -
and O -
rather O -
corpulent O -
body O -
, O -
so O -
that O -
he O -
seemed O -
to O -
be O -
providing O -
himself O -
incessantly O -
with O -
food O -
for O -
amusement O -
and O -
reflection O -
with O -
the O -
least O -
possible O -
expenditure O -
of O -
energy O -
. O -

One O -
might O -
suppose O -
that O -
he O -
had O -
passed O -
the O -
time O -
of O -
life O -
when O -
his O -
ambitions O -
were O -
personal O -
, O -
or O -
that O -
he O -
had O -
gratified O -
them O -
as O -
far O -
as O -
he O -
was O -
likely O -
to O -
do O -
, O -
and O -
now O -
employed O -
his O -
considerable O -
acuteness O -
rather O -
to O -
observe O -
and O -
reflect O -
than O -
to O -
attain O -
any O -
result O -
. O -

Katharine B-PER (1)
, O -
so O -
Denham B-PER (7)
decided O -
, O -
while O -
Mr. B-PER (18
Fortescue O -
built O -
up O -
another O -
rounded O -
structure O -
of O -
words O -
, O -
had O -
a O -
likeness O -
to O -
each O -
of O -
her B-PER (42|(1)
parents I-PER 42)
, O -
but O -
these O -
elements O -
were O -
rather O -
oddly O -
blended O -
. O -

She O -
had O -
the O -
quick O -
, O -
impulsive O -
movements O -
of O -
her B-PER (2|(1)
mother I-PER 2)
, O -
the O -
lips O -
parting O -
often O -
to O -
speak O -
, O -
and O -
closing O -
again O -
; O -
and O -
the O -
dark O -
oval O -
eyes O -
of O -
her B-PER (24|(1)
father I-PER 24)
brimming O -
with O -
light O -
upon O -
a O -
basis O -
of O -
sadness O -
, O -
or O -
, O -
since O -
she O -
was O -
too O -
young O -
to O -
have O -
acquired O -
a O -
sorrowful O -
point O -
of O -
view O -
, O -
one O -
might O -
say O -
that O -
the O -
basis O -
was O -
not O -
sadness O -
so O -
much O -
as O -
a O -
spirit O -
given O -
to O -
contemplation O -
and O -
self-control O -
. O -

Judging O -
by O -
her O -
hair O -
, O -
her O -
coloring O -
, O -
and O -
the O -
shape O -
of O -
her O -
features O -
, O -
she O -
was O -
striking O -
, O -
if O -
not O -
actually O -
beautiful O -
. O -

Decision O -
and O -
composure O -
stamped O -
her O -
, O -
a O -
combination O -
of O -
qualities O -
that O -
produced O -
a O -
very O -
marked O -
character O -
, O -
and O -
one O -
that O -
was O -
not O -
calculated O -
to O -
put O -
a B-PER (7
young I-PER -
man I-PER -
, I-PER -
who I-PER -
scarcely I-PER -
knew I-PER -
her I-PER 7)|(1)
, O -
at O -
his O -
ease O -
. O -

For O -
the B-PER -
rest I-PER -
, O -
she O -
was O -
tall O -
; O -
her O -
dress O -
was O -
of O -
some O -
quiet O -
color O -
, O -
with O -
old O -
yellow-tinted O -
lace O -
for O -
ornament O -
, O -
to O -
which O -
the O -
spark O -
of O -
an O -
ancient O -
jewel O -
gave O -
its O -
one O -
red O -
gleam O -
. O -

Denham B-PER (7)
noticed O -
that O -
, O -
although O -
silent O -
, O -
she O -
kept O -
sufficient O -
control O -
of O -
the O -
situation O -
to O -
answer O -
immediately O -
her B-PER (2|(1)
mother I-PER 2)
appealed O -
to O -
her O -
for O -
help O -
, O -
and O -
yet O -
it O -
was O -
obvious O -
to O -
him O -
that O -
she O -
attended O -
only O -
with O -
the O -
surface O -
skin O -
of O -
her O -
mind O -
. O -

It O -
struck O -
him O -
that O -
her O -
position O -
at O -
the O -
tea-table O -
, O -
among O -
all O -
these B-PER (17
elderly I-PER -
people I-PER 17)
, O -
was O -
not O -
without O -
its O -
difficulties O -
, O -
and O -
he O -
checked O -
his O -
inclination O -
to O -
find O -
her O -
, O -
or O -
her O -
attitude O -
, O -
generally O -
antipathetic O -
to O -
him O -
. O -

The O -
talk O -
had O -
passed O -
over O -
Manchester O -
, O -
after O -
dealing O -
with O -
it O -
very O -
generously O -

then O -
, O -
dear B-PER (18
Mr. I-PER -

, O -
please O -
explain O -
my O -
absurd O -
little O -
puzzle O -

ca O -

” O -

Mr. B-PER (24
Hilbery O -
here O -
interposed O -
so O -
far O -
as O -
Denham B-PER (7)
was O -
concerned O -
, O -
and O -
talked O -
a O -
great O -
deal O -
of O -
sense O -
about O -
the B-PER (46
solicitors I-PER 46)
’ O -
profession O -
, O -
and O -
the O -
changes O -
which O -
he O -
had O -
seen O -
in O -
his O -
lifetime O -
. O -

Indeed O -
, O -
Denham B-PER (7)
properly O -
fell O -
to O -
his O -
lot O -
, O -
owing O -
to O -
the O -
fact O -
that O -
an O -
article O -
by O -
Denham B-PER (7)
upon O -
some O -
legal O -
matter O -
, O -
published O -
by O -
Mr. B-PER (2
Hilbery O -
in O -
his O -
Review O -
, O -
had O -
brought O -
them O -
acquainted O -
. O -

But O -
when O -
a O -
moment O -
later O -
Mrs. B-PER (48
Sutton O -
Bailey O -
was O -
announced O -
, O -
he O -
turned O -
to O -
her O -
, O -
and O -
Mr. B-PER (7
Denham O -
found O -
himself O -
sitting O -
silent O -
, O -
rejecting O -
possible O -
things O -
to O -
say O -
, O -
beside O -
Katharine B-PER (1)
, O -
who O -
was O -
silent O -
too O -
. O -

Being O -
much O -
about O -
the O -
same O -
age O -
and O -
both O -
under O -
thirty O -
, O -
they O -
were O -
prohibited O -
from O -
the O -
use O -
of O -
a O -
great O -
many O -
convenient O -
phrases O -
which O -
launch O -

into O -
smooth O -
waters O -

They O -
were O -
further O -
silenced O -
by O -
Katharine B-PER (1)

rather O -
malicious O -
determination O -
not O -
to O -

in O -
whose O -
upright O -

she O -
detected O -
something O -
hostile O -
to O -
her O -

, O -
by O -
any O -
of O -
the O -
usual O -
feminine O -

They O -
therefore O -
sat O -
silent O -

Denham B-PER (7)
controlling O -
his O -
desire O -
to O -
say O -
something O -
abrupt O -
and O -
explosive O -
, O -
which O -
should O -
shock O -
her O -
into O -

But O -
Mrs. B-PER (2

was O -
immediately O -
sensitive O -
to O -
any O -

in O -
the O -

I O -
AM O -
BORN O -
Whether O -
I O -
shall O -
turn O -
out O -
to O -
be O -
the B-PER (53
hero I-PER -

life I-PER 53)
, O -
or O -
whether O -
that O -

will O -
be O -
held O -
by O -
anybody B-PER (1

, O -
these O -
pages O -
must O -
show O -
. O -

To O -
begin O -
my O -
life O -
with O -
the O -
beginning O -
of O -
my O -
life O -
, O -
I O -
record O -
that O -
I O -
was O -
born O -
( O -
as O -
I O -
have O -
been O -
informed O -
and O -
believe O -
) O -
on O -
a O -
Friday O -
, O -
at O -
twelve O -
o’clock O -
at O -
night O -
. O -

It O -
was O -
remarked O -
that O -
the O -
clock O -
began O -
to O -
strike O -
, O -
and O -
I O -
began O -
to O -
cry O -
, O -
simultaneously O -
. O -

In O -
consideration O -
of O -
the O -
day O -
and O -
hour O -
of O -
my O -
birth O -
, O -
it O -
was O -
declared O -
by O -
the B-PER (2
nurse I-PER 2)
, O -
and O -
by O -
some O -
sage O -
women O -
in O -
the O -
neighbourhood O -
who O -
had O -
taken O -
a O -
lively O -
interest O -
in O -
me O -
several O -
months O -
before O -
there O -
was O -
any O -
possibility O -
of O -
our O -
becoming O -
personally O -
acquainted O -
, O -
first O -
, O -
that O -
I O -
was O -
destined O -
to O -
be O -
unlucky O -
in O -
life O -
; O -
and O -
secondly O -
, O -
that O -
I O -
was O -
privileged O -
to O -
see O -
ghosts O -
and O -
spirits O -
; O -
both O -
these O -
gifts O -
inevitably O -
attaching O -
, O -
as O -
they O -
believed O -
, O -
to O -
all B-PER (6

. O -

I O -
need O -
say O -
nothing O -
here O -
, O -
on O -
the O -
first O -
head O -
, O -
because O -
nothing O -
can O -
show O -
better O -
than O -
my O -
history O -
whether O -
that O -
prediction O -
was O -
verified O -
or O -
falsified O -
by O -
the O -
result O -
. O -

On O -
the O -
second O -
branch O -
of O -
the O -
question O -
, O -
I O -
will O -
only O -
remark O -
, O -
that O -
unless O -
I O -
ran O -
through O -
that O -
part O -
of O -
my O -
inheritance O -
while O -
I O -
was O -
still O -
a B-PER (54
baby I-PER 54)
, O -
I O -
have O -
not O -
come O -
into O -
it O -
yet O -
. O -

But O -
I O -
do O -
not O -
at O -
all O -
complain O -
of O -
having O -
been O -
kept O -
out O -
of O -
this O -
property O -
; O -
and O -
if O -
anybody B-PER (8
else I-PER 8)
should O -
be O -
in O -
the O -
present O -
enjoyment O -
of O -
it O -
, O -
he O -
is O -
heartily O -
welcome O -
to O -
keep O -
it O -
. O -

I O -
was O -
born O -
with O -
a O -
caul O -
, O -
which O -
was O -
advertised O -
for O -
sale O -
, O -
in O -
the O -
newspapers O -
, O -
at O -
the O -
low O -
price O -
of O -
fifteen O -
guineas O -
. O -

Whether O -
sea-going B-PER (9
people I-PER 9)
were O -
short O -
of O -
money O -
about O -
that O -
time O -
, O -
or O -
were O -
short O -
of O -
faith O -
and O -
preferred O -
cork O -

, O -
I O -
do O -
n’t O -
know O -
; O -
all O -
I O -
know O -
is O -
, O -
that O -
there O -
was O -
but O -
one O -
solitary O -
bidding O -
, O -
and O -
that O -
was O -
from O -
an B-PER (10
attorney I-PER -
connected I-PER -
with I-PER -
the I-PER -
bill-broking I-PER -
business I-PER 10)
, O -
who O -
offered O -
two O -
pounds O -
in O -
cash O -
, O -
and O -
the O -

in O -

, O -
but O -
declined O -
to O -
be O -
guaranteed O -
from O -

any O -

bargain O -
. O -

Consequently O -
the O -
advertisement O -
was O -
withdrawn O -
at O -
a O -
dead O -
loss O -
-- O -
for O -
as O -
to O -

and O -
ten O -
years O -
afterwards O -

was O -
put O -
up O -
in O -

down O -

I O -
was O -
present O -

, O -
and O -
I O -
remember O -
to O -

felt O -
quite O -
uncomfortable O -

at O -
a O -

The O -

by O -
an B-PER (16

of O -

, O -
to O -
endeavour O -
without O -
any O -
effect O -
to O -
prove O -
to O -
her O -
. O -

It O -
is O -
a O -
fact O -
which O -
will O -
be O -
long O -
remembered O -
as O -
remarkable O -
down O -
there O -
, O -
that O -
she O -
was O -
never O -
drowned O -
, O -
but O -
died O -
triumphantly O -
in O -
bed O -
, O -
at O -
ninety-two O -
. O -

I O -
have O -
understood O -
that O -
it O -
was O -
, O -
to O -
the O -
last O -
, O -
her O -
proudest O -
boast O -
, O -
that O -
she O -
never O -
had O -
been O -
on O -
the O -
water O -
in O -
her O -
life O -
, O -
except O -
upon O -
a O -
bridge O -
; O -
and O -
that O -
over O -
her O -
tea O -
( O -
to O -
which O -
she O -
was O -
extremely O -
partial O -
) O -
she O -
, O -
to O -
the O -
last O -
, O -
expressed O -
her O -
indignation O -
at O -
the O -
impiety O -
of O -
mariners B-PER (19)
and O -
others O -
, O -
who O -
had O -
the O -
presumption O -
to O -
go O -
‘ O -
meandering O -
’ O -
about O -
the O -
world O -
. O -

It O -
was O -
in O -
vain O -
to O -
represent O -
to O -
her O -
that O -
some O -
conveniences O -
, O -
tea O -
perhaps O -
included O -
, O -
resulted O -
from O -
this O -
objectionable O -
practice O -
. O -

She O -
always O -
returned O -
, O -
with O -
greater O -
emphasis O -
and O -
with O -
an O -
instinctive O -
knowledge O -
of O -
the O -
strength O -
of O -
her O -
objection O -
, O -
‘ O -
Let O -
us O -
have O -
no O -

’ O -

Not O -
to O -
meander O -
myself O -
, O -
at O -
present O -
, O -
I O -
will O -
go O -
back O -
to O -
my O -
birth O -
. O -

I O -
was O -
born O -
at O -
Blunderstone O -
, O -
in O -
Suffolk O -
, O -
or O -
‘ O -
there O -
by O -
’ O -
, O -

in O -
Scotland O -

I O -
was O -
a B-PER (55
posthumous I-PER -
child I-PER 55)
. O -

My B-PER (27|(0)
father I-PER 27)
’s O -
eyes O -
had O -
closed O -
upon O -
the O -
light O -
of O -
this O -
world O -
six O -
months O -
, O -
when O -
mine O -
opened O -
on O -
it O -
. O -

There O -
is O -
something O -
strange O -
to O -
me O -
, O -
even O -
now O -
, O -
in O -
the O -
reflection O -
that O -
he O -
never O -
saw O -
me O -
; O -
and O -
something O -
stranger O -
yet O -
in O -
the O -
shadowy O -
remembrance O -
that O -
I O -
have O -
of O -
my O -
first O -
childish O -
associations O -
with O -
his O -
white O -
grave-stone O -
in O -
the O -
churchyard O -
, O -
and O -
of O -
the O -
indefinable O -
compassion O -
I O -
used O -
to O -
feel O -
for O -
it O -
lying O -
out O -
alone O -
there O -
in O -
the O -
dark O -
night O -
, O -
when O -
our O -
little O -

was O -
warm O -
and O -
bright O -
with O -
fire O -
and O -
candle O -
, O -
and O -
the O -
doors O -
of O -
our O -
house O -
were O -
-- O -
almost O -
cruelly O -
, O -
it O -
seemed O -
to O -
me O -
sometimes O -
-- O -
bolted O -
and O -
locked O -
against O -

An O -
aunt O -
of O -
my B-PER (27|(0)

consequently O -
a B-PER (32

Miss B-PER (32

Miss B-PER (32

as O -
my B-PER (35|(0)
poor I-PER -

always O -
called O -
her O -

when O -
she O -
sufficiently O -
overcame O -
her O -
dread O -
of O -
this B-PER (32
formidable I-PER -
personage I-PER 32)
to O -
mention O -
her O -
at O -
all O -
( O -
which O -
was O -
seldom O -
) O -

had O -
been O -
married O -
to O -
a B-PER (36
husband I-PER -
younger I-PER -
than I-PER -
herself I-PER 36)|(32)
, O -
who O -
was O -
very O -
handsome O -
, O -
except O -
in O -
the O -
sense O -
of O -
the O -
homely O -
adage O -
, O -
‘ O -
handsome O -
is O -
, O -
that O -
handsome O -
does O -
’ O -
-- O -
for O -
he O -
was O -
strongly O -
suspected O -
of O -
having O -
beaten O -
Miss B-PER (32
Betsey O -
, O -
and O -
even O -
of O -
having O -
once O -
, O -
on O -
a O -
disputed O -
question O -
of O -

made O -
some O -
hasty O -

to O -

her O -
out O -
of O -

two O -

These O -
evidences O -
of O -
an O -
incompatibility O -
of O -
temper O -
induced O -
Miss B-PER (32
Betsey O -
to O -
pay O -
him O -
off O -
, O -
and O -
effect O -
a O -
separation O -
by O -
mutual O -
consent O -

He O -
went O -
to O -
India O -
with O -
his O -
capital O -
, O -
and O -
there O -
, O -
according O -
to O -
a O -
wild O -
legend O -
in O -
our B-PER (33|(34)
family I-PER 33)
, O -
he O -
was O -
once O -
seen O -
riding O -
on O -
an O -
elephant O -
, O -
in O -
company O -
with O -
a O -
Baboon O -
; O -
but O -
I O -
think O -
it O -
must O -
have O -
been O -
a O -
Baboo O -
-- O -
or O -
a O -
Begum O -
. O -

Anyhow O -
, O -
from O -
India O -
tidings O -
of O -
his O -
death O -
reached O -
home O -
, O -
within O -
ten O -
years O -

How O -
they O -
affected O -
my B-PER (32|(0)

, O -
nobody B-PER (40)
knew O -
; O -
for O -
immediately O -
upon O -
the O -
separation O -
, O -
she O -
took O -
her O -
maiden O -

again O -

bought O -
a O -
cottage O -
in O -
a O -

on O -
the O -

long O -
way O -
off O -

there O -
as O -
a O -
single O -
woman O -
with O -
one B-PER (44

was O -

to O -

ever O -
afterwards O -
, O -
in O -
an O -
inflexible O -
retirement O -

My B-PER (27|(0)
father I-PER 27)
had O -
once O -
been O -
a B-PER (57
favourite I-PER -
of I-PER -
hers I-PER 57)
, O -
I O -
believe O -
; O -
but O -
she O -
was O -
mortally O -
affronted O -
by O -
his O -
marriage O -
, O -
on O -
the O -
ground O -
that O -
my B-PER (35|(0)

She O -
had O -
never O -

My B-PER (27|(0)
father I-PER 27)
and O -
Miss B-PER (32

age O -
when O -
he O -
married O -
, O -
and O -
of O -
but O -
a O -
delicate O -
constitution O -

He O -
died O -
a O -
year O -
afterwards O -
, O -
and O -
, O -
as O -
I O -
have O -
said O -
, O -
six O -
months O -
before O -
I O -
came O -
into O -
the O -
world O -
. O -

This O -
was O -
the O -
state O -
of O -
matters O -
, O -
on O -
the O -
afternoon O -
of O -
, O -
what O -
I O -
may O -
be O -
excused O -
for O -
calling O -
, O -
that O -
eventful O -
and O -
important O -
Friday O -
. O -

I O -
can O -
make O -
no O -

to O -

at O -

my O -

of O -
what O -
follows O -
. O -

My B-PER (35|(0)
mother I-PER 35)
was O -
sitting O -
by O -
the O -
fire O -
, O -
but O -
poorly O -
in O -
health O -
, O -
and O -
very O -
low O -
in O -
spirits O -
, O -
looking O -
at O -
it O -
through O -
her O -
tears O -
, O -
and O -
desponding O -
heavily O -
about O -
herself O -
and O -
the O -
fatherless O -
little O -
stranger O -
, O -
who O -
was O -
already O -
welcomed O -
by O -
some O -
grosses O -
of O -
prophetic O -
pins O -
, O -
in O -
a O -
drawer O -
upstairs O -
, O -
to O -
a O -
world O -
not O -
at O -
all O -
excited O -
on O -
the O -
subject O -
of O -
his O -
arrival O -
; O -
my B-PER (35|(0)
mother I-PER 35)
, O -
I O -
say O -
, O -
was O -
sitting O -
by O -
the O -
fire O -
, O -
that O -
bright O -
, O -
windy O -
March O -
afternoon O -
, O -
very O -
timid O -
and O -
sad O -
, O -
and O -
very O -
doubtful O -
of O -
ever O -
coming O -
alive O -
out O -
of O -
the O -
trial O -
that O -
was O -
before O -
her O -
, O -
when O -
, O -
lifting O -
her O -
eyes O -
as O -
she O -
dried O -
them O -
, O -
to O -
the O -
window O -
opposite O -
, O -
she O -
saw O -
a O -
strange O -
lady O -
coming O -
up O -
the O -
garden O -
. O -

My B-PER (35|(0)
mother I-PER 35)
had O -
a O -
sure O -
foreboding O -
at O -
the O -
second O -
glance O -
, O -
that O -
it O -
was O -
Miss B-PER (32
Betsey O -
. O -

The O -
setting O -
sun O -
was O -
glowing O -
on O -
the B-PER (32
strange I-PER -
lady I-PER 32)
, O -
over O -
the O -
garden-fence O -
, O -
and O -
she O -
came O -
walking O -
up O -
to O -
the O -
door O -
with O -
a O -
fell O -
rigidity O -
of O -
figure O -
and O -
composure O -
of O -
countenance O -
that O -
could O -
have O -
belonged O -
to O -
nobody B-PER (47)
else O -
. O -

When O -
she O -
reached O -
the O -
house O -
, O -
she O -
gave O -
another O -
proof O -
of O -
her O -
identity O -
. O -

My B-PER (27|(0)
father I-PER 27)
had O -
often O -
hinted O -
that O -
she O -
seldom O -
conducted O -
herself O -
like O -
any B-PER (48
ordinary I-PER -
Christian I-PER 48)
; O -
and O -
now O -
, O -
instead O -
of O -
ringing O -
the O -
bell O -
, O -
she O -
came O -
and O -
looked O -
in O -
at O -
that O -
identical O -
window O -
, O -
pressing O -
the O -
end O -
of O -
her O -
nose O -
against O -
the O -
glass O -
to O -
that O -
extent O -
, O -
that O -
my B-PER (35|(0)
poor I-PER -
dear I-PER -
mother I-PER 35)
used O -
to O -
say O -
it O -
became O -
perfectly O -
flat O -
and O -
white O -
in O -
a O -
moment O -
. O -

She O -
gave O -
my B-PER (35|(0)
mother I-PER 35)
such O -
a O -
turn O -
, O -
that O -
I O -
have O -
always O -
been O -
convinced O -
I O -
am O -
indebted O -
to O -
Miss B-PER (32
Betsey O -
for O -
having O -
been O -
born O -
on O -
a O -
Friday O -
. O -

My B-PER (35|(0)
mother I-PER 35)
had O -
left O -
her O -
chair O -
in O -
her O -
agitation O -
, O -
and O -
gone O -
behind O -
it O -
in O -
the O -
corner O -
. O -

Miss B-PER (32
Betsey O -
, O -
looking O -
round O -
the O -
room O -
, O -
slowly O -
and O -
inquiringly O -
, O -
began O -
on O -
the O -
other O -
side O -
, O -
and O -
carried O -
her O -
eyes O -
on O -
, O -
like O -
a O -
Saracen O -

Head O -
in O -
a O -
Dutch O -
clock O -
, O -
until O -
they O -
reached O -
my B-PER (35|(0)
mother I-PER 35)
. O -

Then O -
she O -
made O -
a O -
frown O -
and O -
a O -
gesture O -
to O -
my B-PER (35|(0)
mother I-PER 35)
, O -
like O -
one O -
who O -
was O -
accustomed O -
to O -

obeyed O -
, O -
to O -
come O -
and O -
open O -
the O -

My B-PER (35|(0)

went O -

‘ O -
Mrs. B-PER (35

said O -
Miss B-PER (32

; O -
the O -
emphasis O -
referring O -
, O -
perhaps O -
, O -
to O -
my B-PER (35|(0)

mourning O -

, O -
and O -
her O -
condition O -

‘ O -
Yes O -

said O -
my B-PER (35|(0)
mother I-PER 35)
, O -
faintly O -
. O -

‘ O -
Miss B-PER (32

said O -
the O -
visitor O -

‘ O -
You O -

heard O -
of O -
her O -
, O -
I O -
dare O -
say O -

’ O -

My B-PER (35|(0)
mother I-PER 35)
answered O -
she O -
had O -
had O -
that O -
pleasure O -
. O -

And O -
she O -
had O -
a O -
disagreeable O -
consciousness O -
of O -
not O -
appearing O -
to O -
imply O -
that O -
it O -
had O -
been O -
an O -
overpowering O -
pleasure O -
. O -

‘ O -
Now O -
you O -
see O -
her O -
, O -
’ O -
said O -
Miss B-PER (32
Betsey O -
. O -

My B-PER (35|(0)
mother I-PER 35)
bent O -
her O -
head O -
, O -
and O -
begged O -
her O -
to O -
walk O -
in O -
. O -

They O -
went O -
into O -
the O -
parlour O -

come O -
from O -

since O -
my B-PER (27|(0)

funeral O -
; O -
and O -
when O -
they O -
were O -
both O -
seated O -
, O -
and O -
Miss B-PER (32

said O -
nothing O -
, O -
my B-PER (35|(0)
mother I-PER 35)
, O -
after O -
vainly O -
trying O -
to O -
restrain O -
herself O -
, O -
began O -
to O -
cry O -
. O -

‘ O -
Oh O -

’ O -

said O -
Miss B-PER (32

in O -
a O -

‘ O -
Do O -

My B-PER (35|(0)

could O -

help O -
it O -

so O -
she O -
cried O -

she O -

had O -
her O -

out O -

‘ O -
Take O -
off O -

Miss B-PER (32

‘ O -

me O -

My B-PER (35|(0)

was O -
too O -
much O -
afraid O -
of O -
her O -
to O -
refuse O -

this O -
odd O -
request O -
, O -
if O -
she O -
had O -
any O -

Therefore O -
she O -
did O -
as O -
she O -
was O -
told O -

did O -
it O -
with O -
such O -
nervous O -
hands O -

her O -

that O -

our O -

For O -
twenty O -

I O -
had O -
been O -
perfectly O -
comfortable O -
; O -
for O -
twenty O -

I O -

many O -

I O -
had O -
said O -
good-by O -
to O -
my B-PER (5|(0)

, O -
and O -
, O -
after O -
watching O -
their O -

And O -
then O -

the O -
madness O -
seized O -
me O -

When O -
I O -
look O -
back O -
over O -
the O -

spent O -
at O -

I O -

Liddy B-PER (6)

I O -
hate O -

I O -
snapped O -

all O -

into O -
a O -

from O -
which O -
you O -
may O -
judge O -
that O -
the O -
summer O -
there O -
was O -
anything O -

a O -
success O -

The O -

been O -
so O -
garbled O -

incomplete O -

as O -

Mr. B-PER (8
Jamieson O -
, O -
the B-PER (95

, O -
said O -
himself O -
he O -
could O -
never O -
have O -
done O -
without O -
me O -
, O -
although O -
he O -
gave O -
me O -
little O -
enough O -
credit O -

in O -

. O -

I O -
shall O -
have O -
to O -
go O -
back O -
several O -
years O -
-- O -
thirteen O -
, O -
to O -
be O -
exact O -
-- O -
to O -
start O -
my O -
story O -
. O -

At O -
that O -
time O -
my B-PER (9|(0)
brother I-PER 9)
died O -
, O -
leaving O -
me O -
his B-PER (10|(9)
two I-PER -
children I-PER 10)
. O -

Halsey B-PER (11)
was O -
eleven O -
then O -
, O -
and O -
Gertrude B-PER (12)
was O -
seven O -
. O -

All O -
the O -
responsibilities O -
of O -
maternity O -
were O -
thrust O -
upon O -
me O -
suddenly O -
; O -
to O -
perfect O -
the O -
profession O -
of O -
motherhood O -
requires O -
precisely O -
as O -
many O -
years O -
as O -
the B-PER (13
child I-PER 13)
has O -
lived O -
, O -
like O -
the B-PER (14
man I-PER -
who I-PER -
started I-PER -
to I-PER -
carry I-PER -
the I-PER -
calf I-PER -
and I-PER -
ended I-PER -
by I-PER -
walking I-PER -
along I-PER -
with I-PER -
the I-PER -
bull I-PER -
on I-PER -
his I-PER (14)
shoulders I-PER 14)
. O -

However O -
, O -
I O -
did O -
the O -
best O -
I O -
could O -
. O -

When O -
Gertrude B-PER (12)
got O -
past O -
the O -
hair-ribbon O -
age O -
, O -
and O -
Halsey B-PER (11)
asked O -
for O -
a O -
scarf-pin O -
and O -
put O -
on O -
long O -
trousers O -
-- O -
and O -
a O -
wonderful O -
help O -
that O -
was O -
to O -
the O -
darning O -
. O -

-- O -
I O -
sent O -
them O -
away O -
to O -
good O -
schools O -
. O -

After O -
that O -
, O -
my O -
responsibility O -
was O -
chiefly O -
postal O -
, O -
with O -
three O -
months O -
every O -
summer O -
in O -
which O -
to O -
replenish O -
their O -
wardrobes O -
, O -
look O -
over O -
their O -
lists O -
of O -
acquaintances O -
, O -
and O -
generally O -
to O -
take O -
my O -
foster-motherhood O -
out O -
of O -
its O -
nine O -
months O -
' O -
retirement O -
in O -
camphor O -
. O -

I O -
missed O -
the O -
summers O -
with O -
them O -
when O -
, O -
somewhat O -
later O -
, O -
at O -
boarding-school O -
and O -
college O -
, O -
the B-PER (10
children I-PER 10)
spent O -
much O -
of O -
their O -
vacations O -
with O -
friends B-PER (18)
. O -

Gradually O -
I O -
found O -
that O -
my O -
name O -
signed O -
to O -
a O -
check O -
was O -
even O -
more O -
welcome O -
than O -
when O -
signed O -
to O -
a O -
letter O -
, O -
though O -
I O -
wrote O -
them O -
at O -
stated O -
intervals O -
. O -

But O -
when O -
Halsey B-PER (11)
had O -
finished O -
his O -
electrical O -
course O -
and O -
Gertrude B-PER (12)
her O -
boarding-school O -
, O -
and O -
both O -
came O -
home O -
to O -
stay O -
, O -
things O -
were O -
suddenly O -
changed O -
. O -

The O -
winter O -
Gertrude B-PER (12)
came O -
out O -
was O -
nothing O -
but O -
a O -
succession O -
of O -
sitting O -
up O -
late O -
at O -
night O -
to O -
bring O -
her O -
home O -
from O -
things O -
, O -
taking O -
her O -
to O -
the B-PER (22
dressmakers I-PER 22)
between O -
naps O -
the O -
next O -
day O -
, O -
and O -
discouraging O -
ineligible B-PER (23
youths I-PER -
with I-PER -
either I-PER -
more I-PER -
money I-PER -
than I-PER -
brains I-PER -
, I-PER -
or I-PER -
more I-PER -
brains I-PER -
than I-PER -
money I-PER 23)
. O -

Also O -
, O -
I O -
acquired O -
a O -
great O -
many O -
things O -
: O -
to O -
say O -
lingerie O -
for O -
under-garments O -
, O -
" O -
frocks O -
" O -
and O -
" O -
gowns O -
" O -
instead O -
of O -
dresses O -
, O -
and O -
that O -
beardless B-PER (24
sophomores I-PER 24)
are O -
not O -
college B-PER (25
boys I-PER 25)
, O -
but O -
college B-PER (26
men I-PER 26)
. O -

Halsey B-PER (11)
required O -
less O -
personal O -
supervision O -
, O -
and O -
as O -
they O -
both O -
got O -
their B-PER (27|(10)
mother I-PER 27)
's O -
fortune O -
that O -
winter O -
, O -
my O -
responsibility O -
became O -
purely O -
moral O -
. O -

Halsey B-PER (11)
bought O -
a O -
car O -
, O -
of O -
course O -
, O -
and O -
I O -
learned O -
how O -
to O -
tie O -
over O -
my O -
bonnet O -
a O -
gray O -
baize O -
veil O -
, O -
and O -
, O -
after O -
a O -
time O -
, O -
never O -
to O -
stop O -
to O -
look O -
at O -
the O -
dogs O -
one O -
has O -
run O -
down O -
. O -

People B-PER (29)
are O -
apt O -
to O -
be O -
so O -
unpleasant O -
about O -
their O -
dogs O -
. O -

The O -
additions O -
to O -
my O -
education O -
made O -
me O -
a B-PER (96
properly I-PER -
equipped I-PER -
maiden I-PER -
aunt I-PER 96)
, O -
and O -
by O -
spring O -
I O -
was O -
quite O -
tractable O -
. O -

So O -
when O -
Halsey B-PER (11)
suggested O -
camping O -
in O -
the O -
Adirondacks O -
and O -
Gertrude B-PER (12)
wanted O -
Bar O -
Harbor O -
, O -
we O -
compromised O -
on O -
a O -
good O -
country O -
house O -
with O -
links O -
near O -
, O -
within O -
motor O -
distance O -
of O -
town O -
and O -
telephone O -
distance O -
of O -
the B-PER (34
doctor I-PER 34)
. O -

That O -
was O -
how O -
we O -
went O -
to O -
Sunnyside O -
. O -

We O -
went O -
out O -
to O -
inspect O -
the O -
property O -
, O -
and O -
it O -
seemed O -
to O -
deserve O -
its O -
name O -
. O -

Its O -
cheerful O -
appearance O -
gave O -
no O -
indication O -
whatever O -
of O -
anything O -
out O -
of O -
the O -
ordinary O -
. O -

Only O -
one O -
thing O -
seemed O -
unusual O -
to O -
me O -
: O -
the B-PER (36
housekeeper I-PER -
, I-PER -
who I-PER -
had I-PER -
been I-PER -
left I-PER -
in I-PER -
charge I-PER 36)
, O -
had O -
moved O -
from O -
the O -
house O -
to O -
the B-PER (38|(39
gardener I-PER 39)
's O -
lodge O -
, O -
a O -
few O -
days O -
before O -
. O -

As O -
the O -
lodge O -
was O -
far O -
enough O -
away O -
from O -
the O -
house O -
, O -
it O -
seemed O -
to O -
me O -
that O -
either O -
fire O -
or O -
thieves B-PER (40)
could O -
complete O -
their O -
work O -
of O -
destruction O -
undisturbed O -
. O -

The O -
property O -
was O -
an O -
extensive O -
one O -
: O -
the O -
house O -
on O -
the O -
top O -
of O -
a O -
hill O -
, O -
which O -
sloped O -
away O -
in O -
great O -
stretches O -
of O -
green O -
lawn O -
and O -
clipped O -
hedges O -
, O -
to O -
the O -
road O -
; O -
and O -
across O -
the O -
valley O -
, O -
perhaps O -
a O -
couple O -
of O -
miles O -
away O -
, O -
was O -
the O -
Greenwood O -
Club O -
House O -
. O -

Gertrude B-PER (12)
and O -
Halsey B-PER (11)
were O -
infatuated O -
. O -

" O -
Why O -
, O -
it O -
's O -
everything O -
you O -
want O -
, O -
" O -
Halsey B-PER (11)
said O -
" O -
View O -
, O -
air O -
, O -
good O -
water O -
and O -
good O -
roads O -
. O -

As O -
for O -
the O -
house O -
, O -
it O -
's O -
big O -
enough O -
for O -
a O -
hospital O -
, O -
if O -
it O -
has O -
a O -
Queen O -
Anne O -
front O -
and O -
a O -
Mary O -
Anne O -
back O -
, O -
" O -
which O -
was O -
ridiculous O -
: O -
it O -
was O -
pure O -
Elizabethan O -
. O -

Of O -
course O -
we O -
took O -
the O -
place O -
; O -
it O -
was O -
not O -
my O -
idea O -
of O -
comfort O -
, O -
being O -
much O -
too O -
large O -
and O -
sufficiently O -
isolated O -
to O -
make O -
the B-PER (49
servant I-PER 49)
question O -
serious O -
. O -

But O -
I O -
give O -
myself O -
credit O -
for O -
this O -
: O -
whatever O -
has O -
happened O -
since O -
, O -
I O -
never O -
blamed O -
Halsey B-PER (11)
and O -
Gertrude B-PER (12)
for O -
taking O -
me O -
there O -
. O -

And O -
another O -
thing O -
: O -
if O -
the O -
series O -
of O -
catastrophes O -
there O -
did O -
nothing O -
else O -
, O -
it O -
taught O -
me O -
one O -
thing O -
-- O -
that O -
somehow O -
, O -
somewhere O -
, O -
from O -
perhaps O -
a B-PER (50
half-civilized I-PER -
ancestor I-PER -
who I-PER -
wore I-PER -
a I-PER -
sheepskin I-PER -
garment I-PER -
and I-PER -
trailed I-PER -
his I-PER (50)
food I-PER -
or I-PER -
his I-PER (50)
prey I-PER 50)
, O -
I O -
have O -
in O -
me O -
the O -
instinct O -
of O -
the O -
chase O -
. O -

Were O -
I O -
a B-PER (51

I O -
should O -
be O -
a O -
trapper O -
of O -
criminals B-PER (53)|52)

trailing O -
them O -
as O -
relentlessly O -
as O -
no O -

my B-PER (50|(0)

did O -
his O -

But O -
being O -

, O -
with O -
the O -
handicap O -
of O -
my O -
sex O -

my O -
first O -

be O -
my O -
last O -

Indeed O -
, O -
it O -
came O -
near O -
enough O -
to O -
being O -
my O -
last O -
acquaintance O -
with O -
anything O -
. O -

The O -
property O -
was O -
owned O -
by O -
Paul B-PER (54

Halsey B-PER (11)
knew O -
Louise B-PER (57

, O -
-- O -
had O -
been O -
rather O -
attentive O -
to O -
her O -
the O -
winter O -
before O -
, O -
but O -
as O -
Halsey B-PER (11)
was O -
always O -
attentive O -
to O -
somebody B-PER (60)
, O -
I O -
had O -
not O -
thought O -
of O -
it O -
seriously O -
, O -
although O -
she O -
was O -
a B-PER (103
charming I-PER -
girl I-PER 103)
. O -

I O -
knew O -
of O -
Mr. B-PER (54
Armstrong O -
only O -
through O -
his O -
connection O -
with O -
the O -
bank O -
, O -
where O -
the O -
children O -

money O -
was O -
largely O -
invested O -

through O -
an O -
ugly O -
story O -
about O -
the B-PER (62

, O -
Arnold B-PER (98

, O -
who O -
was O -
reported O -

for O -
a O -
considerable O -
amount O -
, O -
to O -
some O -
bank O -

. O -

However O -
, O -
the O -
story O -
had O -
had O -
no O -
interest O -
for O -
me O -
. O -

I O -
cleared O -
Halsey B-PER (11)
and O -
Gertrude B-PER (12)
away O -
to O -
a O -
house O -
party O -
, O -
and O -
moved O -
out O -
to O -
Sunnyside O -
the O -
first O -
of O -
May O -

The O -
roads O -
were O -
bad O -

It O -
was O -
a O -
beautiful O -
summer O -

and O -
in O -
whatever O -
fashion O -
the B-PER (29

looked O -
at O -
things O -
, O -
they O -
must O -
have O -
seemed O -
to O -
him O -
charming O -

He O -
had O -
come O -
from O -
Geneva O -
the O -
day O -
before O -
by O -
the O -

to O -

who O -
was O -
staying O -
at O -

having O -
been O -

But O -
his B-PER (32|(29)

had O -
a O -

-- O -
his B-PER (32|(29)
aunt I-PER 32)
had O -
almost O -

a O -

now O -
she O -
was O -
shut O -
up O -

smelling O -
camphor O -

so O -
that O -
he O -

He O -
was O -
some O -
seven-and-twenty O -
years O -

; O -
when O -
his B-PER (34|(29)
friends I-PER 34)
spoke O -
of O -
him O -
, O -
they O -
usually O -
said O -
that O -
he O -
was O -
at O -
Geneva O -
“ O -
studying O -

” O -

When O -
his B-PER (35|(29)
enemies I-PER 35)
spoke O -
of O -
him O -
, O -
they O -
said O -
-- O -
but O -
, O -
after O -
all O -
, O -
he O -
had O -
no B-PER (36

was O -
an B-PER (69

What O -
I O -
should O -
say O -
is O -
, O -
simply O -
, O -
that O -
when O -
certain B-PER (37
persons I-PER 37)
spoke O -
of O -
him O -
they O -
affirmed O -
that O -
the O -
reason O -
of O -
his O -
spending O -
so O -
much O -
time O -
at O -
Geneva O -
was O -
that O -
he O -
was O -

a B-PER (65

Very B-PER (39

indeed O -
, O -
I O -

had O -

seen O -
this B-PER (38

But O -

an O -
old O -

and O -
he O -
had O -
afterward O -
gone O -
to O -

circumstances O -
which O -
had O -
led O -
to O -
his O -
forming O -
a O -
great O -
many O -

Many O -
of O -
these O -
he O -
had O -
kept O -
, O -
and O -
they O -
were O -
a O -
source O -
of O -
great O -
satisfaction O -
to O -
him O -

After O -
knocking O -
at O -
his B-PER (32|(29)

door O -
and O -
learning O -
that O -

was O -
indisposed O -

he O -
had O -
taken O -
a O -
walk O -
about O -

then O -
he O -
had O -
come O -

He O -
had O -
now O -
finished O -
his O -
breakfast O -

“ O -
Will O -

he O -
asked O -
in O -
a O -
sharp O -
, O -

voice O -

a O -
voice O -

Winterbourne B-PER (29)
glanced O -
at O -
the O -
small O -
table O -
near O -
him O -
, O -
on O -
which O -
his O -
coffee O -
service O -
rested O -
, O -
and O -
saw O -
that O -
several O -
morsels O -
of O -
sugar O -
remained O -
. O -

“ O -
Yes O -
, O -
you O -
may O -
take O -

” O -
he O -
answered O -
; O -
“ O -

” O -

This B-PER (43
little I-PER -
boy I-PER 43)
stepped O -
forward O -
and O -
carefully O -
selected O -
three O -
of O -
the O -
coveted O -
fragments O -
, O -
two O -
of O -
which O -
he O -
buried O -
in O -
the O -
pocket O -
of O -
his O -
knickerbockers O -
, O -
depositing O -
the O -

as O -
promptly O -
in O -
another O -

He O -
poked O -
his O -
alpenstock O -
, O -
lance-fashion O -
, O -
into O -
Winterbourne B-PER (29)
’s O -
bench O -
and O -
tried O -
to O -
crack O -
the O -
lump O -
of O -
sugar O -
with O -
his O -
teeth O -
. O -

“ O -
Oh O -
, O -
blazes O -
; O -

” O -

he O -
exclaimed O -
, O -
pronouncing O -
the O -
adjective O -
in O -
a O -
peculiar O -
manner O -
. O -

Winterbourne B-PER (29)
had O -
immediately O -
perceived O -
that O -
he O -
might O -
have O -
the O -
honor O -
of O -
claiming O -
him O -
as O -
a B-PER (67
fellow I-PER -

. O -

“ O -
Take O -
care O -

he O -
said O -
, O -
paternally O -

“ O -
I O -

They O -

I O -

My B-PER (46|(43)

one O -

She O -

Winterbourne B-PER (29)
was O -
much O -
amused O -
. O -

“ O -
If O -
you O -
eat O -

, O -
your B-PER (46|(43)

he O -
said O -

“ O -
She O -

some O -

then O -

” O -
rejoined O -
his B-PER (43|(29)

“ O -

“ O -

” O -

asked O -
Winterbourne O -
. O -

“ O -
I O -

said O -
the B-PER (43

“ O -
I O -
see O -

are O -
one B-PER (70

laughed O -
Winterbourne B-PER (29)
. O -

“ O -
Are O -
you O -
an B-PER (52
American I-PER -
man I-PER 52)
? O -
” O -

pursued O -
this B-PER (43
vivacious I-PER -
infant I-PER 43)
. O -

And O -
then O -
, O -
on O -
Winterbourne B-PER (29)
’s O -
affirmative O -
reply O -
-- O -
“ O -
American B-PER (53

he O -
declared O -
. O -

His B-PER (29|(43)
companion I-PER 29)
thanked O -
him O -
for O -
the O -
compliment O -
, O -
and O -
the B-PER (43
child I-PER 43)
, O -
who O -
had O -
now O -
got O -
astride O -
of O -
his O -
alpenstock O -
, O -
stood O -
looking O -
about O -
him O -
, O -
while O -
he O -
attacked O -
a O -
second O -
lump O -
of O -
sugar O -
. O -

Winterbourne B-PER (29)
wondered O -
if O -
he O -
himself O -
had O -
been O -
like O -
this O -
in O -
his O -
infancy O -
, O -
for O -
he O -
had O -
been O -
brought O -

at O -
about O -
this O -
age O -
. O -

“ O -
Here O -
comes O -
my B-PER (54|(43)

” O -

cried O -
the B-PER (43

in O -
a O -
moment O -
. O -

“ O -
She O -
’s O -
an O -
American B-PER (71

. O -
” O -

Winterbourne B-PER (29)
looked O -
along O -
the O -
path O -
and O -
saw O -
a B-PER (54
beautiful I-PER -
young I-PER -
lady I-PER 54)
advancing O -
. O -

“ O -
American B-PER (55
girls I-PER 55)

the B-PER (72
best I-PER -

, O -
” O -
he O -
said O -
cheerfully O -
to O -
his B-PER (43|(29)
young I-PER -
companion I-PER 43)
. O -

“ O -
My B-PER (54|(43)

the O -

” O -

the B-PER (43

declared O -
. O -

“ O -
She O -

always O -
blowing O -
at O -
me O -

” O -

“ O -
I O -
imagine O -
that O -
is O -
your O -
fault O -
, O -
not O -
hers O -
, O -
” O -
said O -
Winterbourne B-PER (29)
. O -

The B-PER (54
young I-PER -
lady I-PER 54)
meanwhile O -
had O -
drawn O -
near O -
. O -

She O -
was O -
dressed O -
in O -
white O -
muslin O -
, O -
with O -
a O -
hundred O -
frills O -
and O -
flounces O -
, O -
and O -
knots O -
of O -
pale-colored O -
ribbon O -
. O -

She O -
was O -
bareheaded O -
, O -
but O -
she O -
balanced O -
in O -
her O -
hand O -
a O -
large O -
parasol O -
, O -
with O -
a O -
deep O -
border O -
of O -
embroidery O -
; O -
and O -
she O -
was O -
strikingly O -
, O -
admirably O -
pretty O -
. O -

“ O -
How O -
pretty O -
they O -
are O -
! O -
” O -

thought O -
Winterbourne B-PER (29)
, O -
straightening O -
himself O -
in O -
his O -
seat O -
, O -
as O -
if O -
he O -
were O -
prepared O -
to O -
rise O -
. O -

The B-PER (54
young I-PER -
lady I-PER 54)
paused O -
in O -
front O -
of O -
his O -
bench O -
, O -
near O -
the O -
parapet O -
of O -
the O -
garden O -
, O -
which O -
overlooked O -
the O -
lake O -
. O -

The B-PER (43
little I-PER -
boy I-PER 43)
had O -
now O -
converted O -
his O -
alpenstock O -
into O -
a O -
vaulting O -
pole O -
, O -
by O -
the O -
aid O -
of O -
which O -
he O -
was O -
springing O -
about O -
in O -
the O -
gravel O -
and O -
kicking O -
it O -
up O -
not O -
a O -
little O -
. O -

“ O -
Randolph B-PER (43)
, O -
” O -
said O -
the B-PER (54
young I-PER -
lady I-PER 54)
, O -
“ O -
what O -
ARE O -
you O -
doing O -
? O -
” O -

“ O -
I O -
’m O -
going O -
up O -
the O -
Alps O -
, O -
” O -
replied O -
Randolph B-PER (43)
. O -

“ O -
This O -
is O -
the O -
way O -
! O -
” O -

And O -
he O -
gave O -
another O -
little O -
jump O -
, O -
scattering O -
the O -
pebbles O -
about O -
Winterbourne B-PER (29)
’s O -
ears O -
. O -

“ O -
That O -
’s O -
the O -
way O -
they O -
come O -
down O -

” O -
said O -
Winterbourne B-PER (29)
. O -

“ O -
He O -
’s O -
an B-PER (73

! O -
” O -

cried O -
Randolph B-PER (43)
, O -
in O -
his O -
little O -
hard O -
voice O -
. O -

The B-PER (54
young I-PER -
lady I-PER 54)
gave O -
no O -
heed O -
to O -
this O -
announcement O -
, O -
but O -
looked O -
straight O -
at O -
her B-PER (43|(54)
brother I-PER 43)
. O -

“ O -
Well O -
, O -
I O -
guess O -
you O -
had O -
better O -
be O -
quiet O -
, O -
” O -
she O -
simply O -
observed O -
. O -

It O -
seemed O -
to O -
Winterbourne B-PER (29)
that O -
he O -
had O -
been O -
in O -
a O -
manner O -
presented O -
. O -

He O -
got O -
up O -
and O -
stepped O -
slowly O -
toward O -
the B-PER (54
young I-PER -
girl I-PER 54)
, O -
throwing O -
away O -
his O -
cigarette O -
. O -

“ O -
This B-PER (43
little I-PER -
boy I-PER 43)
and O -
I O -
have O -
made O -
acquaintance O -
, O -
” O -
he O -
said O -
, O -
with O -
great O -
civility O -
. O -

In O -
Geneva O -
, O -
as O -
he O -
had O -
been O -
perfectly O -
aware O -
, O -
a B-PER (59
young I-PER -

was O -
not O -
at O -
liberty O -
to O -
speak O -
to O -
a B-PER (60

under O -
certain O -

conditions O -
; O -
but O -
here O -
at O -
Vevey O -
, O -
what O -
conditions O -
could O -
be O -
better O -
than O -
these O -
? O -

-- O -
a B-PER (54

American I-PER -

coming O -
and O -
standing O -
in O -

of O -
you O -
in O -
a O -

This B-PER (54

, O -
however O -
, O -
on O -
hearing O -
Winterbourne B-PER (29)
’s O -
observation O -
, O -
simply O -
glanced O -
at O -
him O -
; O -
she O -
then O -
turned O -
her O -
head O -
and O -
looked O -
over O -
the O -
parapet O -
, O -
at O -
the O -
lake O -
and O -
the O -
opposite O -
mountains O -
. O -

He O -
wondered O -
whether O -
he O -
had O -
gone O -
too O -
far O -
, O -
but O -
he O -
decided O -
that O -
he O -
must O -
advance O -
farther O -
, O -
rather O -
than O -
retreat O -

While O -
he O -
was O -
thinking O -
of O -
something O -

to O -
say O -
, O -
the B-PER (54

turned O -
to O -
the B-PER (43

again O -

“ O -

of O -
his B-PER (51|(0)

It O -
could O -
be O -
done O -
, O -
because O -
there O -
was O -
very O -
little O -
business O -
at O -
any O -
time O -
, O -
and O -
practically O -
none O -
at O -

Mr B-PER (0

cared O -

little O -
about O -
his O -
ostensible O -

. O -

And O -
, O -
moreover O -
, O -
his B-PER (2|(0)

The O -
shop O -
was O -
small O -
, O -
and O -
so O -
was O -
the O -
house O -
. O -

It O -
was O -
one O -
of O -
those O -
grimy O -
brick O -
houses O -
which O -
existed O -
in O -
large O -
quantities O -
before O -
the O -
era O -
of O -

dawned O -
upon O -
London O -
. O -

The O -
shop O -
was O -
a O -
square O -

of O -
a O -

with O -
the O -

in O -
small O -

In O -
the O -
daytime O -
the O -

; O -
in O -
the O -
evening O -
it O -
stood O -
discreetly O -
but O -
suspiciously O -
ajar O -
. O -

The O -
window O -
contained O -
photographs O -

the O -

These B-PER (8

Some B-PER (11

the O -

the O -

But O -
Mr B-PER (0

knew O -

remained O -
undisturbed O -
by O -
any O -

about O -

With O -
a O -
firm O -

steady-eyed O -
impudence O -

which O -
seemed O -
to O -
hold O -
back O -
the O -
threat O -
of O -
some O -

, O -
he O -
would O -
proceed O -
to O -

scandalously O -

it O -
happened O -
that O -

Under O -
our O -

it O -
would O -

that O -

his O -

the O -

When O -

never O -

any O -

On O -

Stevie B-PER (51)

not O -
seem O -
to O -

any O -

what O -
he O -

done O -

His O -
motives O -
for O -
this O -
stroke O -
of O -

were O -
difficult O -
to O -
discover O -

It O -
was O -
only O -
later O -
on O -
that O -
Winnie B-PER (2)
obtained O -
from O -
him O -
a O -
misty O -
and O -
confused O -
confession O -
. O -

It O -
seems O -
that O -
two O -
other O -
office-boys O -
in O -
the O -

had O -
worked O -
upon O -
his O -
feelings O -
by O -

till O -
they O -
had O -
wrought O -
his O -
compassion O -
to O -
the O -

of O -
that O -

But O -
his B-PER (26|(60|(51)

dismissed O -
him O -
summarily O -
as O -
likely O -
to O -
ruin O -
his O -

After O -
that O -
altruistic O -

no O -

The B-PER (73

Such O -
an B-PER (16
assemblage I-PER -
of I-PER -
youth I-PER -
and I-PER -
innocence I-PER 16)
naturally O -
attracted O -
the B-PER (3
young I-PER -
soldiers I-PER 3)
: O -
they O -
stopped O -
; O -
and O -
, O -
as O -

A B-PER (17
tall I-PER -
, I-PER -
elegant I-PER -

looked O -
at O -
Montraville B-PER (2)
and O -
blushed O -
: O -
he O -
instantly O -
recollected O -
the O -
features O -
of O -
Charlotte O -

whom O -
he O -
had O -
once O -
seen O -
and O -
danced O -
with O -

at O -
Portsmouth O -
. O -

At O -
that O -
time O -
he O -
thought O -
on O -
her O -
only O -
as O -
a B-PER (57
very I-PER -
lovely I-PER -
child I-PER 57)
, O -
she O -
being O -
then O -
only O -
thirteen O -
; O -

the O -
improvement O -
two O -

had O -
made O -
in O -
her B-PER (17|(17)

, O -
and O -
the O -
blush O -
of O -
recollection O -
which O -
suffused O -
her O -
cheeks O -
as O -
she O -
passed O -
, O -
awakened O -
in O -
his O -
bosom O -
new O -
and O -
pleasing O -
ideas O -
. O -

Vanity O -
led O -
him O -
to O -
think O -
that O -
pleasure O -
at O -
again O -
beholding O -
him O -
might O -
have O -
occasioned O -
the O -
emotion O -

had O -
witnessed O -
, O -
and O -
the O -

vanity O -
led O -
him O -
to O -
wish O -
to O -
see O -
her O -
again O -
. O -

“ O -
She O -
is O -
the O -
sweetest O -
girl O -
in O -
the O -
world O -

” O -
said O -
he O -
, O -
as O -
he O -
entered O -
the O -
inn O -
. O -

Belcour B-PER (1)
stared O -
. O -

“ O -
Did O -
you O -
not O -
notice O -
her O -
? O -
” O -
continued O -
Montraville B-PER (2)
: O -
“ O -
she O -
had O -
on O -
a O -
blue O -

and O -
with O -
a O -
pair O -
of O -
lovely O -
eyes O -
of O -
the O -

colour O -
, O -
has O -
contrived O -
to O -
make O -
me O -
feel O -
devilish O -
odd O -
about O -

” O -

“ O -
Pho O -
, O -
” O -
said O -
Belcour B-PER (1)
, O -
“ O -
a O -
musket O -

from O -

may O -
in O -

two O -

” O -

“ O -
I O -
never O -

” O -
replied O -
Montraville B-PER (2)
; O -
“ O -
but O -
am O -
determined O -
to O -
make O -
the O -
most O -
of O -
the O -
present O -
, O -
and O -
would O -
willingly O -
compound O -
with O -
any O -
kind O -
Familiar O -
who O -
would O -
inform O -
me O -
who O -
the B-PER (17

, O -
and O -
how O -
I O -
might O -
be O -
likely O -
to O -
obtain O -
an O -
interview O -
. O -
” O -

But O -
no B-PER (21

at O -
that O -
time O -
appearing O -

up O -
to O -
the O -
door O -
, O -
Montraville B-PER (2)
and O -
his B-PER (1|(2)

were O -
obliged O -
to O -
take O -

its B-PER (17|(6)
fair I-PER -
inhabitant I-PER 17)
, O -
and O -
proceed O -
on O -
their O -
journey O -

But O -
Charlotte O -
had O -
made O -
too O -
great O -
an O -
impression O -
on O -
his O -
mind O -
to O -
be O -
easily O -
eradicated O -
: O -
having O -
therefore O -
spent O -
three O -
whole O -
days O -
in O -
thinking O -
on O -
her O -
and O -
in O -
endeavouring O -
to O -
form O -
some O -
plan O -
for O -
seeing O -
her O -
, O -
he O -
determined O -
to O -
set O -
off O -

Chichester O -
, O -
and O -
trust O -
to O -
chance O -
either O -
to O -
favour O -

frustrate O -
his O -
designs O -
. O -

Arriving O -
at O -
the O -
verge O -
of O -
the O -
town O -
, O -
he O -
dismounted O -
, O -
and O -
sending O -
the B-PER (22
servant I-PER 22)
forward O -
with O -
the O -
horses O -
, O -
proceeded O -
toward O -
the O -
place O -
, O -
where O -
, O -
in O -
the O -
midst O -
of O -
an O -
extensive O -
pleasure O -

, O -
stood O -
the O -
mansion O -
which O -
contained O -
the B-PER (17

. O -

Montraville B-PER (2)
leaned O -
on O -
a O -
broken O -
gate O -
, O -
and O -
looked O -
earnestly O -
at O -
the O -
house O -
. O -

The O -
wall O -
which O -
surrounded O -
it O -
was O -
high O -
, O -
and O -
perhaps O -
the O -
Argus O -

who O -
guarded O -
the O -
Hesperian O -

, O -
were O -
more O -

“‘ O -
Tis O -
a O -
romantic O -

, O -
” O -
said O -
he O -
; O -
“ O -
and O -
should O -
I O -
even O -
succeed O -
in O -
seeing O -

conversing O -
with O -
her O -

can O -
be O -
productive O -
of O -
no O -

I O -
must O -
of O -
necessity O -
leave O -
England O -
in O -
a O -
few O -
days O -

probably O -

this B-PER (17

I O -

” O -

The O -
evening O -
now O -
was O -

Queen O -

with O -
her O -

the O -

The O -
mind O -
of O -
Montraville B-PER (2)
was O -
hushed O -
into O -
composure O -
by O -

“ O -
I O -

and O -
two B-PER (26

“ O -
I O -
will O -
at O -

said O -
he O -

He O -
overtook O -
them O -
, O -
and O -
giving O -
them O -
the O -
compliments O -
of O -
the O -

, O -
begged O -

into O -

delighted O -

Cameron B-PER (0)
felt O -
that O -
between O -

himself O -
there O -
was O -
a O -
subtle O -
affinity O -

, O -
one O -

long O -

it O -
was O -

When O -

to O -
his O -

that O -
his B-PER (11|(0)

was O -

And O -
straightway O -
he O -
forgot O -
his B-PER (11|(0)
strange I-PER -

Cameron B-PER (0)
began O -
his O -
day O -
, O -
grateful O -
for O -
the O -
solitude O -
that O -
was O -
now O -
unbroken O -
, O -
for O -
the O -
canyon-furrowed O -

cactus-spired O -

that O -
now O -
showed O -
no O -

in O -
a O -

way O -
, O -
without O -
eagerness O -
, O -
he O -
hunted O -
for O -
signs O -
of O -
gold O -

The O -
work O -
was O -
toilsome O -
, O -
yet O -
the O -
periods O -
of O -
rest O -
in O -
which O -
he O -
indulged O -
were O -

What O -

it O -

up O -

There O -
down O -

came O -

I O -
know O -
not O -

it O -
was O -

but O -
, O -
with O -
the O -
first O -

the O -

a O -
sense O -
of O -
insufferable O -
gloom O -
pervaded O -
my O -
spirit O -
. O -

I O -
say O -
insufferable O -
; O -
for O -
the O -
feeling O -
was O -
unrelieved O -
by O -
any O -
of O -
that O -
half-pleasureable O -
, O -
because O -
poetic O -

sentiment O -

upon O -
a O -

white O -

with O -
an O -
utter O -

of O -
soul O -
which O -
I O -
can O -
compare O -
to O -
no O -

to O -
the O -

There O -
was O -
an O -
iciness O -
, O -
a O -
sinking O -
, O -
a O -
sickening O -
of O -
the O -
heart O -
-- O -
an O -
unredeemed O -
dreariness O -
of O -

no O -

torture O -

aught O -

What O -
was O -
it O -
-- O -
I O -
paused O -
to O -
think O -

what O -
was O -
it O -
that O -
so O -
unnerved O -
me O -
in O -
the O -
contemplation O -
of O -
the O -
House O -

Usher B-PER (3)|2)
? O -

It O -
was O -
a O -
mystery O -
all O -
insoluble O -
; O -
nor O -
could O -
I O -
grapple O -
with O -
the O -
shadowy O -
fancies O -
that O -
crowded O -
upon O -
me O -
as O -
I O -
pondered O -
. O -

I O -
was O -
forced O -
to O -
fall O -
back O -
upon O -
the O -
unsatisfactory O -
conclusion O -
, O -
that O -
while O -
, O -
beyond O -
doubt O -
, O -
there O -
are O -
combinations O -
of O -
very O -
simple O -
natural O -
objects O -
which O -
have O -
the O -
power O -
of O -
thus O -
affecting O -
us O -
, O -
still O -
the O -
analysis O -
of O -
this O -
power O -
lies O -
among O -
considerations O -

It O -
was O -
possible O -

I O -
reflected O -

that O -
a O -
mere O -
different O -
arrangement O -
of O -

particulars O -
of O -
the O -
scene O -
, O -
of O -
the O -
details O -
of O -
the O -
picture O -
, O -
would O -
be O -
sufficient O -
to O -
modify O -
, O -
or O -
perhaps O -
to O -
annihilate O -
its O -
capacity O -
for O -
sorrowful O -
impression O -
; O -
and O -
, O -
acting O -
upon O -
this O -
idea O -
, O -
I O -
reined O -
my O -
horse O -
to O -
the O -
precipitous O -
brink O -
of O -
a O -
black O -
and O -
lurid O -
tarn O -
that O -
lay O -
in O -
unruffled O -
lustre O -
by O -
the O -
dwelling O -
, O -
and O -
gazed O -
down O -
-- O -
but O -
with O -
a O -
shudder O -
even O -
more O -
thrilling O -
than O -
before O -

upon O -
the O -
remodelled O -

inverted O -
images O -

Nevertheless O -
, O -
in O -
this O -
mansion O -

I O -
now O -
proposed O -
to O -
myself O -
a O -

A O -

a O -
letter O -
from O -
him O -

in O -
its O -
wildly O -

The B-PER (12

spoke O -
of O -
acute O -
bodily O -
illness O -
-- O -
of O -
a O -
mental O -
disorder O -
which O -
oppressed O -
him O -
-- O -
and O -
of O -
an O -
earnest O -
desire O -
to O -
see O -
me O -
, O -
as O -
his O -
best O -
, O -
and O -
indeed O -
his B-PER (0|(12)

with O -
a O -
view O -
of O -
attempting O -

the O -
cheerfulness O -
of O -
my O -

, O -
some O -
alleviation O -
of O -
his O -

It O -
was O -
the O -
manner O -
in O -
which O -
all O -
this O -
, O -
and O -
much O -
more O -
, O -
was O -
said O -

it O -
was O -
the O -
apparent O -
heart O -
that O -
went O -
with O -
his O -
request O -

which O -
allowed O -
me O -
no O -
room O -
for O -
hesitation O -
; O -
and O -
I O -
accordingly O -
obeyed O -
forthwith O -
what O -
I O -
still O -
considered O -
a O -
very O -
singular O -
summons O -
. O -

Although O -
, O -
as O -
boys B-PER (13)
, O -
we O -
had O -
been O -
even O -
intimate O -
associates O -
, O -
yet O -
I O -
really O -
knew O -
little O -
of O -
my B-PER (12|(0)

. O -

His O -
reserve O -
had O -
been O -
always O -
excessive O -
and O -
habitual O -
. O -

I O -
was O -
aware O -
, O -
however O -
, O -
that O -
his B-PER (3|(12)

had O -
been O -
noted O -
, O -
time O -
out O -
of O -

, O -
for O -
a O -
peculiar O -
sensibility O -

more O -
than O -
to O -
the O -

beauties O -
of O -

I O -
had O -
learned O -
, O -
too O -
, O -
the O -
very O -
remarkable O -
fact O -
, O -
that O -
the O -
stem O -
of O -
the B-PER (3

, O -
all O -
time-honoured O -
as O -
it O -
was O -

had O -
put O -
forth O -

at O -
no O -
period O -
, O -
any O -
enduring O -
branch O -
; O -
in O -
other O -
words O -
, O -
that O -
the B-PER (3

lay O -
in O -
the O -
direct O -
line O -
of O -
descent O -
, O -
and O -
had O -
always O -
, O -
with O -
very O -
trifling O -
and O -
very O -
temporary O -
variation O -

It O -
was O -
this O -
deficiency O -

considered O -

the O -

this O -

the O -
original O -

the O -
quaint O -
and O -
equivocal O -
appellation O -
of O -
the O -
" O -
House O -
of O -
Usher B-PER 2)|(3)
" O -
-- O -
an O -
appellation O -
which O -
seemed O -
to O -
include O -
, O -
in O -
the O -
minds O -
of O -
the B-PER (16
peasantry I-PER -
who I-PER -
used I-PER -
it I-PER 16)
, O -
both O -
the B-PER (3
family I-PER 3)
and O -
the O -
family O -
mansion O -
. O -

I O -
have O -
said O -
that O -
the O -
sole O -
effect O -
of O -
my O -
somewhat O -
childish O -
experiment O -
-- O -
that O -
of O -
looking O -
down O -
within O -
the O -
tarn O -
-- O -
had O -
been O -
to O -
deepen O -
the O -
first O -
singular O -
impression O -
. O -

There O -
can O -
be O -
no O -
doubt O -
that O -
the O -
consciousness O -
of O -
the O -
rapid O -
increase O -
of O -
my O -
superstition O -
-- O -
for O -
why O -
should O -
I O -
not O -
so O -
term O -
it O -
? O -

-- O -
served O -
mainly O -
to O -
accelerate O -
the O -
increase O -
itself O -
. O -

Such O -
, O -
I O -
have O -
long O -
known O -
, O -
is O -
the O -
paradoxical O -
law O -
of O -
all O -
sentiments O -
having O -
terror O -
as O -
a O -
basis O -
. O -

And O -
it O -
might O -
have O -
been O -
for O -
this O -
reason O -
only O -
, O -
that O -
, O -
when O -
I O -
again O -
uplifted O -
my O -
eyes O -
to O -
the O -
house O -
itself O -
, O -
from O -
its O -
image O -
in O -
the O -
pool O -
, O -
there O -
grew O -
in O -
my O -
mind O -
a O -
strange O -
fancy O -
-- O -
a O -
fancy O -
so O -
ridiculous O -
, O -
indeed O -
, O -
that O -
I O -
but O -
mention O -
it O -
to O -
show O -
the O -
vivid O -
force O -
of O -
the O -
sensations O -
which O -
oppressed O -
me O -
. O -

I O -
had O -
so O -
worked O -
upon O -
my O -
imagination O -
as O -
really O -
to O -
believe O -
that O -
about O -
the O -
whole O -
mansion O -
and O -
domain O -
there O -
hung O -
an O -
atmosphere O -
peculiar O -
to O -
themselves O -
and O -
their O -
immediate O -
vicinity O -
-- O -
an O -
atmosphere O -
which O -
had O -
no O -
affinity O -
with O -
the O -
air O -
of O -
heaven O -
, O -
but O -
which O -
had O -
reeked O -
up O -
from O -
the O -
decayed O -
trees O -
, O -
and O -
the O -
grey O -
wall O -
, O -
and O -
the O -
silent O -
tarn O -
-- O -
a O -
pestilent O -
and O -
mystic O -
vapour O -
, O -
dull O -
, O -
sluggish O -
, O -
faintly O -
discernible O -
, O -
and O -
leaden-hued O -
. O -

Shaking O -
off O -
from O -
my O -
spirit O -
what O -
must O -
have O -
been O -
a O -
dream O -
, O -
I O -
scanned O -
more O -
narrowly O -
the O -
real O -
aspect O -
of O -
the O -
building O -
. O -

Its O -
principal O -
feature O -
seemed O -
to O -
be O -
that O -
of O -
an O -
excessive O -
antiquity O -
. O -

The O -
discoloration O -
of O -
ages O -
had O -
been O -
great O -
. O -

Minute O -
fungi O -
overspread O -
the O -
whole O -
exterior O -
, O -
hanging O -
in O -
a O -
fine O -
tangled O -
web-work O -
from O -
the O -
eaves O -
. O -

Yet O -
all O -
this O -
was O -
apart O -
from O -
any O -
extraordinary O -
dilapidation O -
. O -

No O -
portion O -
of O -
the O -
masonry O -
had O -
fallen O -
; O -
and O -
there O -
appeared O -
to O -
be O -
a O -
wild O -
inconsistency O -
between O -
its O -
still O -
perfect O -
adaptation O -
of O -
parts O -
, O -
and O -
the O -
crumbling O -
condition O -
of O -
the O -
individual O -
stones O -
. O -

In O -
this O -
there O -
was O -
much O -
that O -
reminded O -
me O -
of O -
the O -
specious O -
totality O -
of O -
old O -
wood-work O -
which O -
has O -
rotted O -
for O -
long O -
years O -
in O -
some O -
neglected O -
vault O -
, O -
with O -
no O -
disturbance O -
from O -
the O -
breath O -
of O -
the O -
external O -
air O -
. O -

Beyond O -
this O -
indication O -
of O -
extensive O -
decay O -
, O -
however O -
, O -
the O -
fabric O -
gave O -
little O -
token O -
of O -
instability O -
. O -

Perhaps O -
the O -
eye O -
of O -
a B-PER (19
scrutinizing I-PER -
observer I-PER 19)
might O -
have O -
discovered O -
a O -
barely O -
perceptible O -
fissure O -
, O -
which O -
, O -
extending O -
from O -
the O -
roof O -
of O -
the O -
building O -
in O -
front O -
, O -
made O -
its O -
way O -
down O -
the O -
wall O -
in O -
a O -
zigzag O -
direction O -
, O -
until O -
it O -
became O -
lost O -
in O -
the O -
sullen O -
waters O -
of O -
the O -
tarn O -
. O -

Noticing O -
these O -
things O -
, O -
I O -
rode O -
over O -
a O -
short O -
causeway O -
to O -
the O -
house O -
. O -

A B-PER (23
servant I-PER -
in I-PER -
waiting I-PER 23)
took O -
my O -
horse O -
, O -
and O -
I O -
entered O -
the O -
Gothic O -
archway O -
of O -
the O -
hall O -
. O -

A B-PER (26
valet I-PER -
, I-PER -
of I-PER -
stealthy I-PER -
step I-PER 26)
, O -
thence O -
conducted O -
me O -
, O -
in O -
silence O -
, O -
through O -
many O -
dark O -
and O -
intricate O -
passages O -
in O -
my O -
progress O -
to O -
the O -
studio O -
of O -
his B-PER (12|(26)
master I-PER 12)|28)
. O -

Much O -
that O -
I O -
encountered O -
on O -
the O -
way O -
contributed O -
, O -
I O -
know O -
not O -
how O -
, O -
to O -
heighten O -
the O -
vague O -
sentiments O -
of O -
which O -
I O -
have O -
already O -
spoken O -

still O -

how O -

stirring O -
up O -

On O -
one O -
of O -
the O -
staircases O -
, O -
I O -
met O -
the O -
physician O -
of O -
the B-PER (3
family I-PER 30)|3)
. O -

His O -
countenance O -
, O -
I O -
thought O -
, O -
wore O -
a O -
mingled O -
expression O -
of O -
low O -
cunning O -
and O -
perplexity O -
. O -

He O -
accosted O -
me O -
with O -
trepidation O -
and O -
passed O -
on O -
. O -

The B-PER (26
valet I-PER 26)
now O -
threw O -
open O -
a O -
door O -
and O -
ushered O -
me O -
into O -
the O -
presence O -
of O -
his B-PER (12|(26)
master I-PER 12)
. O -

The O -
room O -
in O -
which O -
I O -
found O -
myself O -
was O -
very O -
large O -
and O -
lofty O -
. O -

The O -
windows O -
were O -
long O -
, O -
narrow O -
, O -
and O -
pointed O -
, O -
and O -
at O -
so O -
vast O -
a O -
distance O -
from O -
the O -
black O -
oaken O -
floor O -
as O -
to O -
be O -
altogether O -
inaccessible O -
from O -
within O -
. O -

Feeble O -
gleams O -
of O -
encrimsoned O -
light O -
made O -
their O -
way O -
through O -
the O -
trellised O -
panes O -
, O -
and O -
served O -
to O -
render O -
sufficiently O -
distinct O -
the O -
more O -
prominent O -
objects O -
around O -
; O -
the O -
eye O -
, O -
however O -
, O -
struggled O -
in O -
vain O -
to O -
reach O -
the O -
remoter O -
angles O -
of O -
the O -
chamber O -

or O -
the O -

the O -

Dark O -

hung O -

The O -
general O -
furniture O -
was O -
profuse O -
, O -
comfortless O -
, O -
antique O -
, O -
and O -
tattered O -
. O -

Many O -
books O -
and O -
musical O -
instruments O -
lay O -
scattered O -
about O -
, O -
but O -
failed O -
to O -
give O -
any O -
vitality O -
to O -
the O -
scene O -
. O -

I O -
felt O -
that O -
I O -
breathed O -
an O -
atmosphere O -
of O -
sorrow O -
. O -

An O -
air O -
of O -
stern O -
, O -
deep O -
, O -
and O -
irredeemable O -
gloom O -
hung O -
over O -
and O -
pervaded O -
all O -

Upon O -
my O -
entrance O -
, O -
Usher B-PER (12)
rose O -
from O -
a O -
sofa O -
on O -
which O -
he O -
had O -
been O -
lying O -
at O -
full O -
length O -
, O -
and O -
greeted O -
me O -
with O -
a O -
vivacious O -
warmth O -
which O -
had O -
much O -
in O -
it O -
, O -
I O -
at O -
first O -
thought O -
, O -
of O -
an O -
overdone O -
cordiality O -
-- O -
of O -
the O -
constrained O -
effort O -
of O -
the O -
ennuye O -
man O -
of O -
the O -
world O -
. O -

A O -
glance O -
, O -
however O -
, O -
at O -
his O -
countenance O -
, O -
convinced O -
me O -
of O -
his O -
perfect O -
sincerity O -
. O -

We O -
sat O -
down O -
; O -
and O -
for O -
some O -
moments O -
, O -
while O -
he O -
spoke O -
not O -
, O -
I O -
gazed O -
upon O -
him O -
with O -
a O -
feeling O -
half O -
of O -
pity O -
, O -
half O -
of O -
awe O -
. O -

Surely O -
, O -
man B-PER (34)
had O -
never O -
before O -
so O -
terribly O -
altered O -
, O -
in O -
so O -
brief O -
a O -

It O -
was O -
with O -

that O -

Yet O -
the O -
character O -

had O -
been O -
at O -
all O -

remarkable O -

A O -
cadaverousness O -

an O -

in O -

the O -
prevailing O -
character O -
of O -
these O -

lay O -
so O -
much O -

that O -
I O -
doubted O -

many O -
reasons O -
it O -
will O -
be O -
prudent O -
to O -
refrain O -
from O -
mentioning O -

which O -
I O -
will O -
assign O -
no O -

, O -
a O -
workhouse O -

and O -
in O -
this O -
workhouse O -
was O -
born O -

on O -
a O -
day O -
and O -
date O -
which O -
I O -
need O -
not O -
trouble O -
myself O -
to O -
repeat O -

inasmuch O -
as O -
it O -
can O -
be O -
of O -
no O -
possible O -
consequence O -
to O -
the O -
reader O -

in O -
this O -
stage O -

chapter O -
. O -

For O -
a O -
long O -
time O -
after O -
it O -
was O -
ushered O -
into O -
this O -
world O -
of O -
sorrow O -
and O -
trouble O -
, O -
by O -
the O -
parish O -
surgeon O -
, O -
it O -
remained O -
a O -
matter O -
of O -
considerable O -
doubt O -
whether O -
the B-PER (3
child I-PER 3)
would O -
survive O -
to O -
bear O -
any O -
name O -
at O -
all O -
; O -
in O -
which O -
case O -
it O -
is O -
somewhat O -
more O -
than O -
probable O -
that O -
these O -
memoirs O -
would O -
never O -
have O -
appeared O -
; O -
or O -
, O -
if O -
they O -
had O -
, O -
that O -
being O -
comprised O -
within O -
a O -
couple O -
of O -
pages O -
, O -
they O -
would O -
have O -
possessed O -
the O -
inestimable O -
merit O -
of O -
being O -
the O -
most O -
concise O -
and O -
faithful O -
specimen O -
of O -
biography O -
, O -
extant O -
in O -
the O -
literature O -
of O -
any O -
age O -
or O -
country O -
. O -

Although O -
I O -
am O -
not O -
disposed O -
to O -
maintain O -
that O -
the O -
being O -
born O -
in O -
a O -
workhouse O -
, O -
is O -
in O -
itself O -
the O -
most O -
fortunate O -
and O -
enviable O -
circumstance O -
that O -
can O -
possibly O -
befall O -
a B-PER (12
human I-PER -
being I-PER 12)
, O -
I O -
do O -
mean O -
to O -
say O -
that O -
in O -
this O -
particular O -
instance O -
, O -
it O -
was O -
the O -
best O -
thing O -
for O -
Oliver B-PER (3
Twist I-PER 3)
that O -
could O -
by O -
possibility O -
have O -
occurred O -
. O -

The O -
fact O -
is O -
, O -
that O -
there O -
was O -
considerable O -
difficulty O -
in O -
inducing O -
Oliver B-PER (3)
to O -
take O -
upon O -
himself O -
the O -
office O -
of O -
respiration O -
, O -
-- O -
a O -
troublesome O -
practice O -
, O -
but O -
one O -
which O -
custom O -
has O -
rendered O -
necessary O -
to O -
our O -
easy O -
existence O -
; O -
and O -
for O -
some O -
time O -
he O -
lay O -
gasping O -
on O -
a O -
little O -
flock O -
mattress O -
, O -
rather O -
unequally O -
poised O -
between O -
this O -
world O -
and O -
the O -
next O -
: O -
the O -
balance O -
being O -
decidedly O -
in O -
favour O -
of O -
the O -
latter O -
. O -

Now O -
, O -
if O -
, O -
during O -
this O -
brief O -
period O -
, O -
Oliver B-PER (3)
had O -
been O -
surrounded O -
by O -
careful B-PER (14
grandmothers I-PER 14)
, O -
anxious B-PER (15
aunts I-PER 15)
, O -
experienced B-PER (16
nurses I-PER 16)
, O -
and O -
doctors B-PER (17
of I-PER -
profound I-PER -
wisdom I-PER 17)
, O -
he O -
would O -
most O -
inevitably O -
and O -
indubitably O -
have O -
been O -
killed O -
in O -
no O -
time O -
. O -

There O -
being O -
nobody B-PER (18)
by O -
, O -
however O -
, O -
but O -
a O -
pauper B-PER (19
old I-PER -

was I-PER -

unwonted I-PER -

; O -
and O -
a O -

who O -
did O -
such O -
matters O -
by O -

; O -
Oliver B-PER (3)
and O -
Nature O -
fought O -
out O -
the O -
point O -
between O -
them O -
. O -

The O -
result O -
was O -
, O -
that O -
, O -
after O -
a O -
few O -
struggles O -
, O -
Oliver B-PER (3)
breathed O -
, O -
sneezed O -
, O -
and O -
proceeded O -
to O -
advertise O -
to O -
the O -
inmates O -
of O -
the O -
workhouse O -
the O -
fact O -
of O -
a O -
new O -
burden O -
having O -
been O -
imposed O -
upon O -
the O -
parish O -
, O -
by O -
setting O -
up O -
as O -
loud O -
a O -
cry O -
as O -
could O -
reasonably O -
have O -
been O -
expected O -
from O -
a B-PER (3
male I-PER -
infant I-PER -
who I-PER -
had I-PER -
not I-PER -
been I-PER -
possessed I-PER -
of I-PER -
that I-PER -
very I-PER -
useful I-PER -
appendage I-PER 3)

a I-PER -

for I-PER -
a I-PER -

than I-PER -
three I-PER -
minutes I-PER -

a I-PER -

. O -

As O -
Oliver B-PER (3)
gave O -
this O -
first O -
proof O -
of O -
the O -
free O -
and O -
proper O -
action O -
of O -
his O -
lungs O -
, O -
the O -
patchwork O -
coverlet O -
which O -
was O -
carelessly O -
flung O -
over O -
the O -
iron O -
bedstead O -
, O -
rustled O -
; O -
the O -
pale O -
face O -
of O -
a B-PER (21
young I-PER -
woman I-PER 21)
was O -
raised O -
feebly O -
from O -
the O -
pillow O -
; O -
and O -
a O -
faint O -
voice O -
imperfectly O -
articulated O -
the O -
words O -
, O -
' O -
Let O -

see O -
the B-PER (3

and O -
die O -

' O -

The B-PER (9
surgeon I-PER 9)
had O -
been O -
sitting O -
with O -
his O -
face O -
turned O -
towards O -
the O -
fire O -
: O -
giving O -
the O -
palms O -
of O -
his O -
hands O -
a O -
warm O -
and O -
a O -
rub O -
alternately O -
. O -

As O -
the B-PER (21
young I-PER -
woman I-PER 21)
spoke O -
, O -
he O -
rose O -
, O -
and O -
advancing O -
to O -
the O -
bed O -
's O -
head O -
, O -
said O -
, O -
with O -
more O -
kindness O -
than O -
might O -
have O -
been O -
expected O -
of O -
him O -
: O -
' O -
Oh O -

interposed O -
the B-PER (19

, O -
hastily O -
depositing O -
in O -
her O -
pocket O -
a O -
green O -
glass O -

, O -
the O -
contents O -
of O -
which O -
she O -

evident O -
satisfaction O -

Apparently O -
this O -
consolatory O -
perspective O -
of O -
a B-PER (0

prospects O -
failed O -
in O -
producing O -
its O -
due O -
effect O -
. O -

The B-PER (21
patient I-PER 21)
shook O -
her O -
head O -
, O -
and O -
stretched O -
out O -
her O -
hand O -
towards O -
the B-PER (3

The B-PER (9

deposited O -
it O -
in O -
her O -

She O -
imprinted O -
her O -
cold O -

passionately O -
on O -

her O -

chafed O -

his O -

Warwick B-PER (5)
's O -
first O -
glance O -
had O -
revealed O -
the O -
fact O -
that O -
the B-PER (73
young I-PER -
woman I-PER 73)
was O -
strikingly O -
handsome O -
, O -
with O -
a O -
stately O -
beauty O -
seldom O -

As O -
he O -
walked O -
along O -

distance O -

he O -
could O -
not O -
help O -
noting O -
the O -
details O -
that O -
made O -
up O -
this O -
pleasing O -
impression O -
, O -
for O -
his O -
mind O -
was O -
singularly O -
alive O -
to O -
beauty O -
, O -
in O -
whatever O -
embodiment O -
. O -

The B-PER (73
girl I-PER 73)
's O -
figure O -
, O -
he O -
perceived O -
, O -
was O -
admirably O -
proportioned O -
; O -
she O -
was O -
evidently O -
at O -
the O -
period O -
when O -
the O -
angles O -
of O -
childhood O -
were O -
rounding O -
into O -
the O -
promising O -
curves O -
of O -
adolescence O -
. O -

Her O -
abundant O -
hair O -
, O -
of O -
a O -
dark O -
and O -
glossy O -
brown O -
, O -
was O -
neatly O -
plaited O -

coiled O -

that O -
rose O -
straight O -
from O -
a O -

outlined O -

could O -
see O -
that O -

tastefully O -

that O -

The B-PER (2

being O -

up O -

clutched O -
their B-PER (3|(2)

their O -

One B-PER (7

grave O -

“ O -

A B-PER (8

voice O -
beside O -
her O -
made O -
her O -
start O -
and O -
turn O -
. O -

She O -
had O -
noticed O -
the B-PER (8

more O -
than O -
once O -
amongst O -
the B-PER (9

passengers I-PER 9)
. O -

There O -
had O -
been O -
a O -
hint O -
of O -
mystery O -
about O -
him O -
which O -
had O -
appealed O -
to O -
her O -
imagination O -
. O -

He O -
spoke O -
to O -
no B-PER (10

If O -
anyone B-PER (11)
spoke O -
to O -
him O -
he O -
was O -
quick O -
to O -
rebuff O -
the O -
overture O -
. O -

Also O -
he O -
had O -
a O -
nervous O -
way O -
of O -
looking O -
over O -
his O -
shoulder O -
with O -
a O -
swift O -
, O -
suspicious O -
glance O -
. O -

She O -
noticed O -
now O -
that O -
he O -
was O -
greatly O -
agitated O -
. O -

There O -
were O -
beads O -
of O -
perspiration O -
on O -
his O -
brow O -

He O -
was O -
evidently O -
in O -
a O -
state O -
of O -
overmastering O -
fear O -

And O -
yet O -
he O -
did O -
not O -
strike O -
her O -
as O -
the B-PER (12

“ O -

Her O -
grave O -
eyes O -
met O -
his O -
inquiringly O -

He O -
stood O -
looking O -
at O -
her O -
with O -
a O -
kind O -
of O -
desperate O -

“ O -

himself O -

“ O -

aloud O -

a O -
shock O -

His O -

was O -
pleasantly O -

he O -
walked O -

the B-PER (63

. O -

Simon B-PER (64
Moonan I-PER 64)
told O -

the B-PER (20

The B-PER (63

turned O -
to O -
Simon B-PER (64

said O -
: O -

We O -

Suck O -
was O -
a O -
queer O -
word O -
. O -

The B-PER (63
fellow I-PER 63)
called O -
Simon B-PER (64
Moonan I-PER 64)
that O -
name O -
because O -
Simon B-PER (64
Moonan I-PER 64)
used O -
to O -
tie O -
the B-PER (20
prefect I-PER 20)
's O -
false O -

behind O -
his O -
back O -
and O -
the B-PER (20
prefect I-PER 20)
used O -
to O -
let O -
on O -
to O -
be O -
angry O -
. O -

But O -
the O -
sound O -
was O -
ugly O -
. O -

Once O -
he O -
had O -
washed O -
his O -
hands O -
in O -
the O -
lavatory O -
of O -
the O -
Wicklow O -
Hotel O -
and O -
his B-PER (2|(1)

pulled O -
the O -
stopper O -
up O -
by O -
the O -
chain O -
after O -
and O -
the O -
dirty O -
water O -
went O -
down O -
through O -
the O -
hole O -
in O -
the O -
basin O -
. O -

And O -
when O -
it O -
had O -
all O -
gone O -
down O -
slowly O -
the O -
hole O -
in O -
the O -
basin O -
had O -
made O -
a O -
sound O -
like O -
that O -
: O -
suck O -
. O -

Only O -
louder O -
. O -

To O -
remember O -
that O -
and O -
the O -
white O -
look O -
of O -
the O -
lavatory O -
made O -
him O -
feel O -
cold O -
and O -
then O -
hot O -
. O -

There O -
were O -
two O -
cocks O -
that O -
you O -
turned O -
and O -
water O -
came O -
out O -
: O -
cold O -
and O -
hot O -
. O -

He O -
felt O -
cold O -
and O -
then O -
a O -
little O -
hot O -
: O -
and O -
he O -
could O -
see O -
the O -
names O -
printed O -
on O -
the O -
cocks O -
. O -

That O -
was O -
a O -
very O -
queer O -
thing O -
. O -

And O -
the O -
air O -
in O -
the O -
corridor O -
chilled O -
him O -
too O -
. O -

It O -
was O -
queer O -
and O -
wettish O -
. O -

But O -
soon O -
the O -
gas O -
would O -
be O -
lit O -
and O -
in O -
burning O -
it O -
made O -
a O -
light O -
noise O -
like O -
a O -
little O -
song O -
. O -

Always O -
the O -
same O -
: O -
and O -
when O -
the B-PER (71
fellows I-PER 71)
stopped O -
talking O -
in O -
the O -
playroom O -
you O -
could O -
hear O -
it O -
. O -

It O -
was O -
the O -
hour O -
for O -
sums O -
. O -

Father B-PER (61
Arnall O -
wrote O -
a O -
hard O -
sum O -
on O -
the O -

and O -
then O -
said O -
: O -

Now O -

Stephen B-PER (1)
tried O -
his O -
best O -
, O -
but O -
the O -
sum O -
was O -
too O -
hard O -
and O -
he O -
felt O -
confused O -
. O -

The O -
little O -
silk O -

with O -
the O -
white O -
rose O -
on O -
it O -
that O -
was O -
pinned O -
on O -
the O -
breast O -
of O -
his O -
jacket O -
began O -
to O -
flutter O -
. O -

He O -
was O -
no O -
good O -
at O -
sums O -
, O -
but O -
he O -
tried O -
his O -
best O -
so O -
that O -
York O -
might O -
not O -
lose O -
. O -

Father B-PER (61
Arnall O -
's O -
face O -
looked O -
very O -
black O -
, O -
but O -
he O -
was O -
not O -
in O -
a O -
wax O -
: O -
he O -
was O -
laughing O -
. O -

Then O -
Jack B-PER (41
Lawton I-PER 41)
cracked O -
his O -
fingers O -
and O -
Father B-PER (61
Arnall O -
looked O -
at O -
his O -
copybook O -
and O -
said O -
: O -
-- O -
Right O -

Bravo O -

Jack B-PER (41

looked O -
over O -
from O -
his O -
side O -
. O -

The O -
little O -
silk O -
badge O -
with O -
the O -
red O -
rose O -
on O -
it O -
looked O -
very O -
rich O -
because O -
he O -
had O -
a O -
blue O -
sailor O -
top O -
on O -
. O -

Stephen B-PER (1)
felt O -
his O -
own O -
face O -
red O -
too O -
, O -
thinking O -
of O -
all O -
the O -
bets O -
about O -
who O -
would O -
get O -
first O -

in O -

, O -
Jack B-PER (41

or O -
he O -
. O -

Some O -
weeks O -
Jack B-PER (41
Lawton I-PER 41)
got O -
the O -
card O -
for O -
first O -
and O -
some O -
weeks O -
he O -
got O -
the O -
card O -
for O -
first O -
. O -

His O -
white O -
silk O -
badge O -
fluttered O -
and O -
fluttered O -
as O -
he O -
worked O -
at O -
the O -
next O -
sum O -
and O -
heard O -
Father B-PER (61
Arnall O -
's O -
voice O -
. O -

Then O -
all O -
his O -
eagerness O -
passed O -
away O -
and O -
he O -
felt O -
his O -
face O -
quite O -
cool O -
. O -

He O -
thought O -
his O -
face O -
must O -
be O -
white O -
because O -
it O -
felt O -
so O -
cool O -
. O -

He O -
could O -
not O -
get O -
out O -
the O -
answer O -
for O -
the O -
sum O -
but O -
it O -
did O -
not O -
matter O -
. O -

White O -
roses O -
and O -
red O -
roses O -
: O -
those O -
were O -
beautiful O -
colours O -
to O -
think O -
of O -
. O -

And O -
the O -
cards O -
for O -
first O -
place O -
and O -
second O -
place O -
and O -
third O -
place O -
were O -
beautiful O -
colours O -
too O -
: O -
pink O -
and O -
cream O -
and O -
lavender O -

Lavender O -
and O -
cream O -
and O -
pink O -
roses O -
were O -
beautiful O -
to O -
think O -
of O -
. O -

Perhaps O -
a O -
wild O -
rose O -
might O -
be O -
like O -
those O -
colours O -
and O -
he O -
remembered O -
the O -
song O -
about O -
the O -
wild O -
rose O -
blossoms O -
on O -
the O -
little O -
green O -
place O -

But O -
you O -
could O -
not O -
have O -
a O -
green O -
rose O -

CHAPTER O -
I O -
PARIS O -
: O -
SEPTEMBER O -
, O -
1792 O -
A O -
surging O -
, O -
seething O -
, O -
murmuring O -
crowd O -
of O -
beings O -
that O -
are O -
human O -
only O -
in O -
name O -
, O -
for O -
to O -
the O -
eye O -
and O -
ear O -
they O -
seem O -
naught O -
but O -
savage B-PER (102
creatures I-PER 102)
, O -
animated O -
by O -
vile O -
passions O -
and O -
by O -
the O -
lust O -
of O -
vengeance O -
and O -
of O -
hate O -
. O -

The O -
hour O -
, O -
some O -
little O -
time O -
before O -
sunset O -
, O -
and O -
the O -
place O -
, O -
the O -
West O -
Barricade O -
, O -
at O -
the O -
very O -
spot O -
where O -
, O -
a O -
decade O -
later O -
, O -
a B-PER (55
proud I-PER -
tyrant I-PER 55)
raised O -
an O -
undying O -
monument O -
to O -
the O -
nation O -
's O -
glory O -
and O -
his O -
own O -
vanity O -
. O -

During O -
the O -
greater O -
part O -
of O -
the O -
day O -
the O -
guillotine O -
had O -
been O -
kept O -
busy O -
at O -
its O -
ghastly O -
work O -
: O -
all O -
that O -
France O -
had O -
boasted O -
of O -
in O -
the O -
past O -
centuries O -
, O -
of O -
ancient O -
names O -
, O -
and O -
blue O -
blood O -
, O -
had O -
paid O -
toll O -
to O -
her O -
desire O -
for O -
liberty O -
and O -
for O -
fraternity O -
. O -

The O -
carnage O -
had O -
only O -
ceased O -
at O -
this O -
late O -
hour O -
of O -
the O -
day O -
because O -
there O -
were O -
other O -
more O -
interesting O -
sights O -
for O -
the B-PER (4
people I-PER 4)
to O -
witness O -
, O -
a O -
little O -
while O -
before O -
the O -
final O -
closing O -
of O -
the O -
barricades O -
for O -
the O -
night O -
. O -

And O -
so O -
the B-PER (7
crowd I-PER 7)
rushed O -
away O -
from O -
the O -
Place O -
de O -
la O -
Greve O -
and O -
made O -
for O -
the O -
various O -
barricades O -
in O -
order O -
to O -
watch O -
this O -
interesting O -
and O -
amusing O -
sight O -
. O -

It O -
was O -
to O -
be O -
seen O -
every O -
day O -
, O -
for O -
those B-PER (6
aristos I-PER 6)
were O -
such B-PER (99
fools I-PER 99)
! O -

They O -
were O -
traitors O -
to O -
the B-PER (4
people I-PER 4)|103)
of O -
course O -
, O -
all O -
of O -
them O -
, O -
men O -
, O -
women O -
, O -
and O -
children O -
, O -
who O -
happened O -
to O -
be O -
descendants O -
of O -
the O -
great O -
men O -
who O -
since O -
the O -
Crusades O -
had O -
made O -
the O -
glory O -
of O -
France O -
: O -
her B-PER (10|(3)
old I-PER -
NOBLESSE I-PER 10)
. O -

Their B-PER (11|(6)
ancestors I-PER 11)
had O -
oppressed O -
the B-PER (4
people I-PER 4)
, O -
had O -
crushed O -
them O -
under O -
the O -
scarlet O -
heels O -
of O -
their O -
dainty O -
buckled O -
shoes O -
, O -
and O -
now O -
the B-PER (4
people I-PER 4)
had O -
become O -
the O -
rulers O -
of O -
France O -
and O -
crushed O -
their B-PER (6|(4)
former I-PER -
masters I-PER 6)
-- O -
not O -
beneath O -
their O -
heel O -
, O -
for O -
they O -
went O -
shoeless O -
mostly O -
in O -
these O -
days O -
-- O -
but O -
a O -
more O -
effectual O -
weight O -
, O -
the O -
knife O -
of O -
the O -
guillotine O -
. O -

And O -
daily O -
, O -
hourly O -
, O -
the O -
hideous O -
instrument O -
of O -
torture O -
claimed O -
its B-PER (13
many I-PER -
victims I-PER 13)
-- O -
old B-PER (14
men I-PER 14)
, O -
young B-PER (15
women I-PER 15)
, O -
tiny B-PER (16
children I-PER 16)
until O -
the O -
day O -
when O -
it O -
would O -
finally O -
demand O -
the O -
head O -
of O -
a B-PER (17
King I-PER 17)
and O -
of O -
a B-PER (18
beautiful I-PER -
young I-PER -
Queen I-PER 18)
. O -

But O -
this O -
was O -
as O -
it O -
should O -
be O -
: O -
were O -
not O -
the B-PER (4
people I-PER 4)
now O -
the O -
rulers O -
of O -
France O -
? O -

Every B-PER (19
aristocrat I-PER 19)
was O -
a B-PER (100
traitor I-PER 100)
, O -
as O -
his B-PER (20|(39)
ancestors I-PER 20)
had O -
been O -
before O -
him O -
: O -
for O -
two O -
hundred O -
years O -
now O -
the B-PER (4
people I-PER 4)
had O -
sweated O -
, O -
and O -
toiled O -
, O -
and O -
starved O -
, O -
to O -
keep O -
a O -
lustful O -
court O -
in O -
lavish O -
extravagance O -
; O -
now O -
the O -
descendants O -
of O -
those B-PER (21
who I-PER -
had I-PER -
helped I-PER -
to I-PER -
make I-PER -
those I-PER -
courts I-PER -
brilliant I-PER 21)|6)
had O -
to O -
hide O -
for O -
their O -
lives O -
-- O -
to O -
fly O -
, O -
if O -
they O -
wished O -
to O -
avoid O -
the O -
tardy O -
vengeance O -
of O -
the B-PER (4
people I-PER 4)
. O -

And O -
they O -
did O -
try O -
to O -
hide O -
, O -
and O -
tried O -
to O -
fly O -
: O -
that O -
was O -
just O -
the O -
fun O -
of O -
the O -
whole O -
thing O -
. O -

Every O -
afternoon O -
before O -
the O -
gates O -
closed O -
and O -
the O -
market O -
carts O -
went O -
out O -
in O -
procession O -
by O -
the O -
various O -
barricades O -
, O -
some O -
fool O -
of O -
an B-PER (24
aristo I-PER 24)|23)
endeavoured O -
to O -
evade O -
the O -
clutches O -
of O -
the O -
Committee O -
of O -
Public O -
Safety O -
. O -

In O -
various O -
disguises O -
, O -
under O -
various O -
pretexts O -
, O -
they O -
tried O -
to O -
slip O -
through O -
the O -
barriers O -
, O -
which O -
were O -
so O -
well O -
guarded O -
by O -
citizen O -
soldiers O -
of O -
the O -
Republic O -
. O -

Men O -
in O -
women B-PER (29)
's O -

, O -
women B-PER (30
in I-PER -
male I-PER -
attire I-PER 30)
, O -
children O -
disguised O -
in O -
beggars B-PER (32)
' O -
rags O -
: O -
there O -
were O -
some O -
of O -
all O -
sorts O -
: O -
CI-DEVANT O -
counts O -
, O -
marquises O -
, O -
even O -
dukes O -
, O -
who O -
wanted O -
to O -
fly O -
from O -
France O -
, O -
reach O -
England O -
or O -
some O -
other O -
equally O -
accursed O -
country O -
, O -
and O -
there O -
try O -
to O -
rouse O -
foreign O -
feelings O -
against O -
the O -
glorious O -
Revolution O -
, O -
or O -
to O -
raise O -
an B-PER (35
army I-PER 35)
in O -
order O -
to O -
liberate O -
the O -
wretched O -
prisoners O -
in O -
the O -
Temple O -
, O -
who O -
had O -
once O -
called O -
themselves O -
sovereigns O -
of O -
France O -
. O -

But O -
they O -
were O -
nearly O -
always O -
caught O -
at O -
the O -
barricades O -
, O -
Sergeant B-PER (39
Bibot O -
especially O -
at O -
the O -
West O -
Gate O -
had O -
a O -
wonderful O -
nose O -
for O -
scenting O -
an B-PER (41
aristo I-PER -
in I-PER -
the I-PER -
most I-PER -
perfect I-PER -
disguise I-PER 41)
. O -

Then O -
, O -
of O -
course O -
, O -
the O -
fun O -
began O -
. O -

Bibot B-PER (39)
would O -
look O -
at O -
his B-PER (42|(39)
prey I-PER 42)
as O -
a O -
cat O -
looks O -
upon O -
the O -
mouse O -
, O -
play O -
with O -
him O -
, O -
sometimes O -
for O -
quite O -
a O -
quarter O -
of O -
an O -
hour O -
, O -
pretend O -
to O -
be O -
hoodwinked O -
by O -
the O -
disguise O -
, O -
by O -
the O -
wigs O -
and O -
other O -
bits O -
of O -
theatrical O -
make-up O -
which O -
hid O -
the O -
identity O -
of O -
a B-PER (43
CI-DEVANT I-PER -
noble I-PER -
marquise I-PER -
or I-PER -
count I-PER 43)
. O -

Oh O -
! O -

Bibot B-PER (39)
had O -
a O -
keen O -
sense O -
of O -
humour O -
, O -
and O -
it O -
was O -
well O -
worth O -
hanging O -
round O -
that O -
West O -
Barricade O -
, O -
in O -
order O -
to O -
see O -
him O -
catch O -
an B-PER (44
aristo I-PER 44)
in O -
the O -
very O -
act O -
of O -
trying O -
to O -
flee O -
from O -
the O -
vengeance O -
of O -
the B-PER (4
people I-PER 4)
. O -

Sometimes O -
Bibot B-PER (39)
would O -
let O -
his B-PER (42|(39)
prey I-PER 42)
actually O -
out O -
by O -
the O -
gates O -
, O -
allowing O -
him O -
to O -
think O -
for O -
the O -
space O -
of O -
two O -
minutes O -
at O -
least O -
that O -
he O -
really O -
had O -
escaped O -
out O -
of O -
Paris O -
, O -
and O -
might O -
even O -
manage O -
to O -
reach O -
the O -
coast O -
of O -
England O -
in O -
safety O -
, O -
but O -
Bibot B-PER (39)
would O -
let O -
the B-PER (42
unfortunate I-PER -
wretch I-PER 42)
walk O -
about O -
ten O -
metres O -
towards O -
the O -
open O -
country O -
, O -
then O -
he O -
would O -
send O -
two B-PER (47
men I-PER 47)
after O -
him O -
and O -
bring O -
him O -
back O -
, O -
stripped O -
of O -
his O -
disguise O -
. O -

Oh O -
! O -

that O -
was O -
extremely O -
funny O -
, O -
for O -
as O -
often O -
as O -
not O -
the B-PER (42
fugitive I-PER 42)
would O -
prove O -
to O -
be O -
a B-PER (48
woman I-PER 48)
, O -
some O -
proud O -
marchioness O -
, O -
who O -
looked O -
terribly O -
comical O -
when O -
she O -
found O -
herself O -
in O -
Bibot B-PER (39)
's O -
clutches O -
after O -
all O -
, O -
and O -
knew O -
that O -
a O -
summary O -
trial O -
would O -
await O -
her O -
the O -
next O -
day O -
and O -
after O -
that O -
, O -
the O -
fond O -
embrace O -
of O -
Madame O -
la O -
Guillotine O -
. O -

No O -
wonder O -
that O -
on O -
this O -
fine O -
afternoon O -
in O -
September O -
the O -
crowd O -
round O -
Bibot B-PER (39)
's O -
gate O -
was O -
eager O -
and O -
excited O -
. O -

The O -
lust O -
of O -
blood O -
grows O -
with O -
its O -
satisfaction O -
, O -
there O -
is O -
no O -
satiety O -
: O -
the B-PER (49
crowd I-PER 49)
had O -
seen O -
a O -
hundred O -
noble O -
heads O -
fall O -
beneath O -
the O -
guillotine O -
to-day O -
, O -
it O -
wanted O -
to O -
make O -
sure O -
that O -
it O -
would O -
see O -
another B-PER (50
hundred I-PER 50)
fall O -
on O -
the O -
morrow O -
. O -

Bibot B-PER (39)
was O -
sitting O -
on O -
an O -
overturned O -
and O -
empty O -
cask O -
close O -
by O -
the O -
gate O -
of O -
the O -
barricade O -
; O -
a O -
small O -
detachment O -
of O -
citoyen B-PER (51
soldiers I-PER 51)
was O -
under O -
his O -
command O -
. O -

The O -
work O -
had O -
been O -
very O -
hot O -
lately O -
. O -

Those B-PER (6
cursed I-PER -
aristos I-PER 6)
were O -
becoming O -
terrified O -
and O -
tried O -
their O -
hardest O -
to O -
slip O -
out O -
of O -
Paris O -
: O -
men O -
, O -
women O -
and O -
children O -
, O -
whose O -
ancestors B-PER 97)
, O -
even O -
in O -
remote O -
ages O -
, O -
had O -
served O -
those B-PER (52
traitorous I-PER -
Bourbons I-PER 52)|6)
, O -
were O -
all O -
traitors B-PER (105)
themselves O -
and O -
right O -
food O -
for O -
the O -
guillotine O -
. O -

Every O -
day O -
Bibot B-PER (39)
had O -
had O -
the O -
satisfaction O -
of O -
unmasking O -
some B-PER (53
fugitive I-PER -
royalists I-PER 53)
and O -
sending O -
them O -
back O -
to O -
be O -
tried O -
by O -
the O -
Committee O -
of O -
Public O -
Safety O -
, O -
presided O -
over O -
by O -
that B-PER (54
good I-PER -
patriot I-PER 54)
, O -
Citoyen B-PER (106
Foucquier-Tinville I-PER 106)
. O -

Robespierre B-PER (55)
and O -
Danton B-PER (56)
both O -
had O -
commended O -
Bibot B-PER (39)
for O -
his O -
zeal O -
and O -
Bibot B-PER (39)
was O -
proud O -
of O -
the O -
fact O -
that O -
he O -
on O -
his O -
own O -
initiative O -
had O -
sent O -
at B-PER (57
least I-PER -
fifty I-PER -
aristos I-PER 57)
to O -
the O -
guillotine O -
. O -

But O -
to-day O -
all B-PER (58
the I-PER -
sergeants I-PER -
in I-PER -
command I-PER -
at I-PER -
the I-PER -
various I-PER -
barricades I-PER 58)
had O -
had O -
special O -
orders O -
. O -

Recently O -
a O -
very O -
great O -
number O -
of O -
aristos B-PER (59)
had O -
succeeded O -
in O -
escaping O -
out O -
of O -
France O -
and O -
in O -
reaching O -
England O -
safely O -
. O -

There O -
were O -
curious O -
rumours O -
about O -
these O -
escapes O -
; O -
they O -
had O -
become O -
very O -
frequent O -
and O -
singularly O -
daring O -
; O -
the B-PER (4
people I-PER 4)
's O -
minds O -
were O -
becoming O -
strangely O -
excited O -
about O -
it O -
all O -
. O -

Sergeant B-PER (60
Grospierre O -
had O -
been O -
sent O -
to O -
the O -
guillotine O -
for O -
allowing O -
a B-PER (61
whole I-PER -
family I-PER -
of I-PER -
aristos I-PER 61)
to O -
slip O -
out O -
of O -
the O -
North O -
Gate O -
under O -
his O -
very O -
nose O -
. O -

It O -
was O -
asserted O -
that O -
these O -
escapes O -
were O -
organised O -
by O -
a O -
band O -
of O -
Englishmen O -
, O -
whose O -
daring O -
seemed O -
to O -
be O -
unparalleled O -
, O -
and O -
who O -
, O -
from O -
sheer O -
desire O -
to O -
meddle O -
in O -
what O -
did O -
not O -
concern O -
them O -
, O -
spent O -
their O -
spare O -
time O -
in O -
snatching O -
away O -
lawful B-PER (6
victims I-PER -
destined I-PER -
for I-PER -
Madame I-PER -
la I-PER -
Guillotine I-PER 6)|62)
. O -

These O -
rumours O -
soon O -
grew O -
in O -
extravagance O -
; O -
there O -
was O -
no O -
doubt O -
that O -
this B-PER (62
band I-PER -
of I-PER -
meddlesome I-PER -
Englishmen I-PER 62)
did O -
exist O -
; O -
moreover O -
, O -
they O -
seemed O -
to O -
be O -
under O -
the O -
leadership O -
of O -
a B-PER (63
man I-PER -
whose I-PER -
pluck I-PER -
and I-PER -
audacity I-PER -
were I-PER -
almost I-PER -
fabulous I-PER 63)
. O -

Strange O -
stories O -
were O -
afloat O -
of O -
how O -
he O -
and O -
those B-PER (64
aristos I-PER -
whom I-PER -
he I-PER (63)
rescued I-PER 64)
became O -
suddenly O -
invisible O -
as O -
they O -
reached O -
the O -
barricades O -
and O -
escaped O -
out O -
of O -
the O -
gates O -
by O -
sheer O -
supernatural O -
agency O -
. O -

No B-PER (65
one I-PER 65)
had O -
seen O -
these B-PER (62
mysterious I-PER -
Englishmen I-PER 62)
; O -
as O -
for O -
their B-PER (63|(62)
leader I-PER 63)
, O -
he O -
was O -
never O -
spoken O -
of O -
, O -
save O -
with O -
a O -
superstitious O -
shudder O -
. O -

Citoyen B-PER (54
Foucquier-Tinville I-PER 54)
would O -
in O -
the O -
course O -
of O -
the O -
day O -
receive O -
a O -
scrap O -
of O -
paper O -
from O -
some O -
mysterious O -
source O -
; O -
sometimes O -
he O -
would O -
find O -
it O -
in O -
the O -
pocket O -
of O -
his O -
coat O -
, O -
at O -
others O -
it O -
would O -
be O -
handed O -
to O -
him O -
by O -
someone O -
in O -
the B-PER (66
crowd I-PER 66)
, O -
whilst O -
he O -
was O -
on O -
his O -
way O -

the O -

on O -
Christmas O -

in O -
an O -

somebody B-PER (3)

case O -

I O -
may O -
mention O -

was O -
that O -
of O -
an O -
apparition O -
in O -

such O -

the O -

consequence O -
to O -
which O -
I O -
call O -
attention O -

Someone B-PER (9

told O -
a O -
story O -
not O -
particularly O -
effective O -
, O -
which O -
I O -
saw O -
he O -
was O -
not O -
following O -
. O -

This O -
I O -
took O -
for O -
a O -
sign O -
that O -
he O -
had O -
himself O -
something O -
to O -
produce O -
and O -
that O -
we O -
should O -
only O -
have O -
to O -
wait O -

We O -
waited O -
in O -
fact O -

two O -
nights O -

; O -
but O -
that O -
same O -
evening O -
, O -
before O -
we O -
scattered O -

brought O -
out O -
what O -
was O -
in O -

“ O -
I O -

But O -
it O -

not O -
the O -
first O -
occurrence O -
of O -

that O -
I O -

“ O -

somebody B-PER (15)
exclaimed O -

“ O -
that O -

that O -

Douglas B-PER (8)
there O -
before O -
the O -

to O -
which O -
he O -
had O -
got O -
up O -
to O -

his O -

looking O -
down O -
at O -
his B-PER (16|(8)

“ O -

This O -
, O -
naturally O -
, O -
was O -
declared O -
by O -
several B-PER (18

give O -
the O -

and O -
our B-PER (8|(0)

with O -
quiet O -

prepared O -
his O -

his O -

over O -

“ O -
For O -
sheer O -

I O -
remember O -
asking O -

He O -
seemed O -
to O -
say O -
it O -
was O -
not O -
so O -
simple O -
as O -
that O -
; O -
to O -
be O -
really O -
at O -

how O -
to O -

it O -

He O -
passed O -
his O -
hand O -
over O -
his O -
eyes O -
, O -
made O -
a O -
little O -
wincing O -
grimace O -

“ O -

“ O -

how O -

cried O -
one O -
of O -
the B-PER (19

He O -
took O -
no O -
notice O -
of O -
her O -

he O -
looked O -
at O -
me O -
, O -
but O -
as O -
if O -
, O -
instead O -
of O -
me O -
, O -
he O -
saw O -
what O -
he O -
spoke O -
of O -

“ O -

“ O -

I O -
said O -
, O -
“ O -

He O -
turned O -
round O -
to O -
the O -

gave O -
a O -
kick O -
to O -
a O -
log O -

it O -

the O -

by O -

also O -

“ O -
She O -

he O -
quietly O -
said O -

“ O -
She O -

the B-PER (52

It O -

I O -
was O -
at O -

I O -
found O -
her O -
at O -
home O -
on O -
my O -
coming O -
down O -
the O -
second O -
summer O -

I O -
was O -
much O -
there O -
that O -

was O -
a O -
beautiful O -
one O -

and O -
we O -

some O -
strolls O -

talks O -
in O -
the O -

talks O -
in O -
which O -
she O -
struck O -
me O -
as O -
awfully O -
clever O -

nice O -
. O -

Oh O -
yes O -
; O -
do O -
n’t O -
grin O -
: O -
I O -
liked O -
her O -
extremely O -
and O -
am O -
glad O -
to O -
this O -

she O -
liked O -
me O -

too O -

If O -
she O -
had O -
n’t O -
she O -
would O -

She O -
had O -
never O -

anyone B-PER (31)

It O -
was O -

simply O -
that O -
she O -
said O -
so O -

that O -
I O -
knew O -

I O -
was O -
sure O -

I O -
could O -

easily O -

why O -
when O -
you O -

” O -

“ O -
Because O -
the O -

such O -

continued O -
to O -

“ O -
You O -

” O -
he O -
repeated O -

“ O -
YOU O -

I O -
fixed O -
him O -
, O -
too O -

“ O -
I O -
see O -

She O -
was O -
in O -

He O -
laughed O -
for O -
the O -
first O -
time O -

“ O -
You O -

acute O -

Yes O -
, O -
she O -

That O -

she O -
could O -

tell O -
her O -

without O -
its O -
coming O -
out O -

I O -
saw O -
it O -
, O -
and O -
she O -
saw O -
I O -
saw O -
it O -
; O -
but O -
neither O -
of O -
us O -

I O -
remember O -
the O -

the O -

the O -
long O -

hot O -

It O -
was O -
n’t O -
a O -
scene O -
for O -
a O -

oh O -

” O -

He O -
quitted O -
the O -

“ O -
You O -

“ O -

round O -
again O -

“ O -
Is O -

anybody B-PER (37)

It O -
was O -
almost O -
the O -

“ O -

cried O -

. O -

Mrs. B-PER (41

, O -
however O -
, O -
expressed O -
the O -

“ O -

“ O -

“ O -

Douglas O -

” O -

somebody B-PER (42

inquired O -

He O -
sprang O -
to O -
his O -

again O -

“ O -

” O -

And O -
quickly O -
catching O -
up O -
a O -
candlestick O -
, O -
he O -
left O -
us O -
slightly O -
bewildered O -
. O -

From O -
our O -
end O -
of O -
the O -
great O -
brown O -
hall O -
we O -
heard O -
his O -
step O -
on O -
the O -
stair O -
; O -
whereupon O -
Mrs. B-PER (41
Griffin O -
spoke O -
. O -

“ O -
Well O -

if O -
I O -
do O -
n’t O -
know O -

“ O -
She O -

” O -
said O -
her B-PER (44|(41)
husband I-PER 44)
. O -

“ O -
Raison O -

at O -

But O -
it O -

his O -

reticence O -
. O -
” O -

“ O -
Forty O -
years O -

” O -

Griffin B-PER (41)
put O -
in O -
. O -

“ O -
With O -
this O -
outbreak O -
at O -

” O -

“ O -
The O -
outbreak O -
, O -
” O -
I O -
returned O -
, O -
“ O -
will O -
make O -
a O -
tremendous O -
occasion O -
of O -
Thursday O -
night O -
; O -
” O -
and O -
everyone B-PER (0)
so O -
agreed O -
with O -
me O -
that O -
, O -
in O -
the O -
light O -
of O -
it O -
, O -
we O -
lost O -
all O -
attention O -
for O -
everything O -
else O -
. O -

The O -
last O -
story O -
, O -
however O -
incomplete O -
and O -
like O -
the O -
mere O -
opening O -
of O -
a O -
serial O -
, O -
had O -
been O -
told O -
; O -
we O -
handshook O -
and O -
“ O -
candlestuck O -
, O -
” O -
as O -
somebody B-PER (46)
said O -
, O -
and O -
went O -
to O -
bed O -
. O -

I O -
knew O -
the O -
next O -
day O -
that O -
a O -
letter O -
containing O -
the O -
key O -
had O -
, O -
by O -
the O -
first O -
post O -
, O -
gone O -
off O -
to O -
his O -
London O -
apartments O -
; O -
but O -
in O -
spite O -
of O -
-- O -
or O -
perhaps O -
just O -
on O -
account O -
of O -
-- O -
the O -
eventual O -
diffusion O -
of O -
this O -
knowledge O -
we O -
quite O -
let O -
him O -
alone O -
till O -
after O -
dinner O -
, O -
till O -
such O -
an O -
hour O -
of O -
the O -
evening O -
, O -
in O -
fact O -
, O -
as O -
might O -
best O -
accord O -
with O -
the O -
kind O -
of O -
emotion O -
on O -
which O -
our O -
hopes O -
were O -
fixed O -
. O -

Then O -
he O -
became O -
as O -
communicative O -
as O -
we O -
could O -
desire O -
and O -
indeed O -
gave O -
us O -
his O -
best O -
reason O -
for O -
being O -
so O -
. O -

We O -
had O -
it O -
from O -
him O -
again O -
before O -
the O -
fire O -
in O -
the O -
hall O -
, O -
as O -
we O -
had O -
had O -
our O -
mild O -
wonders O -
of O -
the O -
previous O -
night O -
. O -

It O -
appeared O -
that O -
the O -
narrative O -
he O -
had O -
promised O -
to O -
read O -
us O -
really O -
required O -
for O -
a O -
proper O -
intelligence O -
a O -
few O -
words O -
of O -

Let O -

say O -

distinctly O -

to O -

done O -
with O -
it O -

that O -

Buda-Pesth O -
seems O -
a O -
wonderful O -
place O -
, O -
from O -
the O -
glimpse O -

I O -
got O -

it O -
from O -
the O -

and O -
the O -
little O -
I O -
could O -
walk O -
through O -

I O -
feared O -
to O -
go O -
very O -
far O -
from O -
the O -
station O -
, O -
as O -
we O -
had O -
arrived O -
late O -
and O -
would O -
start O -
as O -
near O -
the O -
correct O -
time O -
as O -
possible O -

The O -
impression O -
I O -
had O -
was O -
that O -
we O -
were O -
leaving O -
the O -
West O -

entering O -
the O -
East O -
; O -
the O -
most O -

took O -
us O -

We O -
left O -
in O -
pretty O -
good O -
time O -

came O -
after O -
nightfall O -
to O -
Klausenburgh O -

Here O -
I O -
stopped O -
for O -
the O -
night O -
at O -
the O -
Hotel O -

I O -
had O -
for O -

a O -

I O -
asked O -
the B-PER (16

, O -
and O -
he O -
said O -
it O -
was O -
called O -
" O -
paprika O -

" O -
and O -
that O -
, O -
as O -
it O -

I O -
should O -
be O -
able O -
to O -
get O -
it O -
anywhere O -
along O -
the O -
Carpathians O -

I O -
found O -
my O -
smattering O -
of O -
German O -
very O -
useful O -
here O -
; O -
indeed O -
, O -
I O -
do O -

I O -

Having O -
had O -
some O -
time O -
at O -
my O -
disposal O -
when O -
in O -
London O -
, O -
I O -
had O -
visited O -
the O -
British O -
Museum O -
, O -
and O -
made O -
search O -
among O -
the O -
books O -
and O -
maps O -
in O -
the O -
library O -
regarding O -
Transylvania O -
; O -
it O -
had O -
struck O -
me O -
that O -
some O -
foreknowledge O -
of O -
the O -
country O -
could O -
hardly O -
fail O -
to O -
have O -
some O -
importance O -
in O -
dealing O -
with O -
a O -
nobleman O -
of O -
that O -
country O -
. O -

I O -
find O -
that O -
the O -
district O -
he O -
named O -
is O -
in O -
the O -
extreme O -
east O -
of O -
the O -
country O -
, O -
just O -
on O -
the O -
borders O -
of O -
three O -
states O -
, O -
Transylvania O -
, O -
Moldavia O -
and O -
Bukovina O -
, O -
in O -
the O -
midst O -
of O -
the O -
Carpathian O -
mountains O -
; O -
one O -
of O -
the O -
wildest O -
and O -
least O -
known O -
portions O -
of O -
Europe O -
. O -

I O -
was O -
not O -
able O -
to O -
light O -
on O -
any O -
map O -
or O -
work O -
giving O -
the O -
exact O -
locality O -

there O -
are O -
no O -

yet O -
to O -
compare O -
with O -
our O -
own O -

I O -
found O -
that O -
Bistritz O -
, O -
the O -
post O -
town O -
named O -
by O -
Count B-PER (22
Dracula O -
, O -
is O -
a O -
fairly O -
well-known O -
place O -
. O -

I O -
shall O -
enter O -
here O -
some O -
of O -
my O -
notes O -
, O -
as O -
they O -
may O -
refresh O -
my O -
memory O -
when O -
I O -
talk O -
over O -
my O -
travels O -
with O -
Mina B-PER (15)
. O -

In O -
the O -
population O -
of O -
Transylvania O -
there O -
are O -
four O -
distinct O -
nationalities O -
: O -
Saxons O -
in O -
the O -
South O -
, O -
and O -
mixed O -
with O -
them O -
the B-PER (36
Wallachs I-PER 36)
, O -
who O -
are O -
the O -
descendants O -
of O -
the B-PER (37
Dacians I-PER 36)|37)
; O -
Magyars B-PER (38)
in O -
the O -
West O -
, O -
and O -
Szekelys B-PER (40)
in O -
the O -
East O -
and O -
North O -
. O -

I O -
am O -
going O -
among O -
the B-PER (40
latter I-PER 40)
, O -
who O -
claim O -
to O -
be O -
descended O -
from O -
Attila B-PER (43)
and O -
the O -
Huns B-PER (44)
. O -

This O -
may O -
be O -
so O -
, O -
for O -
when O -
the B-PER (38
Magyars I-PER 38)
conquered O -
the O -
country O -
in O -
the O -
eleventh O -
century O -
they O -
found O -
the B-PER (44
Huns I-PER 44)
settled O -
in O -
it O -
. O -

I O -
read O -
that O -
every O -
known O -
superstition O -
in O -
the O -
world O -
is O -
gathered O -
into O -
the O -
horseshoe O -
of O -
the O -
Carpathians O -
, O -
as O -
if O -
it O -
were O -
the O -
centre O -
of O -
some O -
sort O -
of O -
imaginative O -
whirlpool O -
; O -
if O -
so O -
my O -
stay O -
may O -
be O -
very O -
interesting O -
. O -

( O -

, O -
I O -
must O -
ask O -
the B-PER (22
Count I-PER 22)
all O -
about O -
them O -
. O -
) O -

I O -
did O -
not O -
sleep O -
well O -
, O -
though O -
my O -
bed O -
was O -
comfortable O -
enough O -
, O -
for O -
I O -
had O -
all O -
sorts O -
of O -
queer O -
dreams O -
. O -

There O -
was O -
a O -
dog O -
howling O -
all O -
night O -
under O -
my O -
window O -
, O -
which O -
may O -
have O -
had O -
something O -
to O -
do O -
with O -
it O -
; O -
or O -
it O -
may O -
have O -
been O -
the O -
paprika O -
, O -
for O -
I O -
had O -
to O -
drink O -
up O -
all O -
the O -
water O -
in O -
my O -
carafe O -
, O -
and O -
was O -
still O -
thirsty O -
. O -

Towards O -
morning O -
I O -
slept O -
and O -
was O -
wakened O -
by O -
the O -
continuous O -
knocking O -
at O -
my O -
door O -
, O -
so O -
I O -
guess O -
I O -
must O -
have O -
been O -
sleeping O -
soundly O -
then O -
. O -

I O -
had O -
for O -
breakfast O -
more O -
paprika O -
, O -
and O -
a O -
sort O -
of O -
porridge O -
of O -
maize O -
flour O -
which O -
they O -
said O -
was O -
" O -
mamaliga O -
, O -
" O -
and O -
egg-plant O -
stuffed O -
with O -
forcemeat O -
, O -
a O -
very O -
excellent O -
dish O -
, O -
which O -

call O -
" O -

I O -
had O -
to O -
hurry O -
breakfast O -
, O -
for O -
the O -
train O -
started O -
a O -
little O -
before O -
eight O -
, O -
or O -
rather O -
it O -
ought O -
to O -
have O -
done O -
so O -
, O -
for O -
after O -
rushing O -
to O -
the O -
station O -
at O -
7:30 O -
I O -
had O -
to O -
sit O -
in O -
the O -
carriage O -
for O -
more O -
than O -
an O -
hour O -
before O -
we O -
began O -
to O -
move O -
. O -

It O -
seems O -
to O -
me O -
that O -
the O -
further O -
east O -
you O -
go O -
the O -
more O -
unpunctual O -
are O -
the O -
trains O -
. O -

What O -
ought O -
they O -
to O -
be O -
in O -
China O -
? O -

All O -
day O -
long O -
we O -
seemed O -
to O -
dawdle O -
through O -
a O -
country O -
which O -
was O -
full O -
of O -
beauty O -
of O -
every O -
kind O -
. O -

Sometimes O -
we O -
saw O -
little O -
towns O -
or O -
castles O -
on O -
the O -
top O -
of O -
steep O -
hills O -
such O -
as O -
we O -
see O -
in O -
old O -
missals O -
; O -
sometimes O -
we O -
ran O -
by O -
rivers O -
and O -
streams O -
which O -
seemed O -
from O -
the O -
wide O -
stony O -
margin O -
on O -
each O -
side O -
of O -
them O -
to O -
be O -
subject O -
to O -
great O -
floods O -
. O -

It O -
takes O -
a O -
lot O -
of O -
water O -
, O -
and O -
running O -
strong O -
, O -
to O -
sweep O -
the O -
outside O -
edge O -
of O -
a O -
river O -
clear O -
. O -

At O -
every O -
station O -
there O -
were O -
groups B-PER (63
of I-PER -
people I-PER 63)|(65)
, O -
sometimes O -
crowds B-PER (64)
, O -
and O -
in O -
all O -
sorts O -
of O -
attire O -
. O -

Some O -
of O -
them O -
were O -
just O -
like O -
the O -
peasants O -
at O -
home O -
or O -
those O -
I O -
saw O -
coming O -
through O -
France O -
and O -
Germany O -
, O -
with O -
short O -
jackets O -
and O -
round O -
hats O -
and O -
home-made O -
trousers O -
; O -
but O -
others O -
were O -
very O -
picturesque O -
. O -

The B-PER (71
women I-PER 71)
looked O -
pretty O -
, O -
except O -
when O -
you O -
got O -
near O -
them O -
, O -
but O -
they O -
were O -
very O -
clumsy O -
about O -
the O -
waist O -
. O -

They O -
had O -
all O -
full O -
white O -
sleeves O -
of O -
some O -
kind O -
or O -
other O -
, O -
and O -
most O -
of O -
them O -
had O -
big O -
belts O -
with O -
a O -
lot O -
of O -
strips O -
of O -
something O -
fluttering O -
from O -
them O -
like O -
the O -
dresses O -
in O -
a O -
ballet O -
, O -
but O -
of O -
course O -
there O -
were O -
petticoats O -
under O -
them O -
. O -

The O -
strangest O -
figures O -
we O -
saw O -
were O -
the B-PER (73
Slovaks I-PER 73)
, O -
who O -
were O -
more O -
barbarian O -
than O -
the O -
rest O -
, O -
with O -
their O -
big O -
cow-boy O -
hats O -
, O -
great O -
baggy O -
dirty-white O -
trousers O -
, O -
white O -
linen O -
shirts O -
, O -
and O -
enormous O -
heavy O -
leather O -
belts O -
, O -
nearly O -
a O -
foot O -
wide O -
, O -
all O -
studded O -
over O -
with O -
brass O -
nails O -
. O -

They O -
wore O -
high O -
boots O -
, O -
with O -
their O -
trousers O -
tucked O -
into O -
them O -
, O -
and O -
had O -
long O -
black O -
hair O -
and O -
heavy O -
black O -
moustaches O -
. O -

They O -
are O -
very O -
picturesque O -
, O -
but O -
do O -
not O -
look O -
prepossessing O -
. O -

On O -
the O -
stage O -
they O -
would O -
be O -
set O -
down O -
at O -
once O -
as O -
some O -
old O -
Oriental O -
band O -
of O -
brigands B-PER (74)|89)
. O -

They O -
are O -
, O -
however O -
, O -
I O -
am O -
told O -
, O -
very O -
harmless O -
and O -
rather O -
wanting O -
in O -
natural O -
self-assertion O -
. O -

It O -
was O -
on O -
the O -
dark O -
side O -
of O -
twilight O -
when O -
we O -
got O -
to O -
Bistritz O -
, O -
which O -
is O -
a O -
very O -
interesting O -
old O -
place O -

a O -
very O -
stormy O -
existence O -
, O -
and O -
it O -
certainly O -
shows O -
marks O -
of O -
it O -
. O -

Fifty O -
years O -
ago O -
a O -
series O -
of O -
great O -
fires O -
took O -
place O -
, O -
which O -
made O -
terrible O -
havoc O -
on O -
five O -
separate O -
occasions O -
. O -

At O -
the O -
very O -
beginning O -
of O -
the O -
seventeenth O -

it O -
underwent O -
a O -

of O -

to O -

was O -

when O -
I O -
got O -
near O -

I O -
faced O -
a B-PER (80

on O -

reticent O -

This O -

up O -

he O -

he O -

out O -
that O -

that O -

that O -
they O -

It O -
was O -

I O -

no O -

any B-PER (84

Just O -
before O -
I O -
was O -
leaving O -
, O -
the B-PER (80

came O -
up O -
to O -
my O -

said O -
in O -

" O -

She O -
was O -
in O -
such O -
an O -
excited O -
state O -
that O -
she O -
seemed O -
to O -
have O -
lost O -
her O -
grip O -
of O -
what O -
German O -
she O -
knew O -
, O -
and O -
mixed O -
it O -
all O -
up O -
with O -
some O -

language O -
which O -
I O -
did O -
not O -
know O -
at O -

I O -
was O -
just O -
able O -
to O -
follow O -
her O -
by O -
asking O -
many O -
questions O -

When O -
I O -
told O -
her O -
that O -
I O -
must O -

once O -
, O -

that O -
I O -
was O -
engaged O -

asked O -
again O -
: O -
" O -

I O -
answered O -
that O -
it O -
was O -
the O -
fourth O -
of O -

She O -
shook O -
her O -
head O -
as O -

again O -

my O -
saying O -

went O -
on O -
: O -
" O -

is O -

you O -

She O -
was O -
in O -
such O -
evident O -
distress O -
that O -
I O -
tried O -
to O -
comfort O -
her O -
, O -
but O -
without O -
effect O -
. O -

Finally O -
she O -
went O -
down O -
on O -
her O -
knees O -
and O -
implored O -
me O -
not O -
to O -
go O -
; O -
at O -
least O -
to O -
wait O -
a O -
day O -
or O -
two O -
before O -
starting O -
. O -

It O -
was O -
all O -
very O -
ridiculous O -
but O -
I O -
did O -
not O -
feel O -
comfortable O -
. O -

However O -
, O -
there O -
was O -
business O -
to O -
be O -
done O -
, O -
and O -
I O -
could O -
allow O -
nothing O -
to O -
interfere O -
with O -
it O -
. O -

I O -
therefore O -
tried O -
to O -
raise O -
her O -
up O -
, O -
and O -
said O -
, O -
as O -
gravely O -
as O -
I O -
could O -
, O -
that O -
I O -
thanked O -
her O -
, O -
but O -
my O -
duty O -
was O -
imperative O -
, O -
and O -
that O -
I O -
must O -
go O -
. O -

She O -
then O -
rose O -
and O -
dried O -
her O -
eyes O -
, O -
and O -
taking O -
a O -
crucifix O -
from O -
her O -
neck O -
offered O -
it O -
to O -
me O -
. O -

I O -
did O -
not O -

by O -

the B-PER (6

looked O -

The B-PER (8

fiercely O -

The B-PER (8

himself O -
, O -
though O -
he O -
had O -
good O -
reason O -
to O -
believe O -
that O -

held O -
nothing O -

flaxen O -

the O -

sometimes O -
it O -
happened O -
that O -
Marner B-PER (37)
, O -
pausing O -
to O -
adjust O -
an O -
irregularity O -
in O -
his O -
thread O -

became O -
aware O -

and O -
, O -
though O -
chary O -
of O -
his O -

he O -
liked O -

would O -
descend O -

Such O -

Raveloe O -
was O -
a O -

many O -
of O -

It O -
was O -
fifteen O -
years O -
since O -
Silas B-PER (37

had O -
first O -
come O -
to O -
Raveloe O -
; O -
he O -
was O -
then O -
simply O -
a O -
pallid O -
young O -
man O -
, O -
with O -
prominent O -
short-sighted O -
brown O -
eyes O -
, O -
whose O -
appearance O -
would O -
have O -
had O -
nothing O -
strange O -
for O -
people B-PER (73
of I-PER -
average I-PER -

and I-PER -

, O -
but O -
for O -
the B-PER (74
villagers I-PER -
near I-PER -
whom I-PER -
he I-PER (37)
had I-PER -
come I-PER -
to I-PER -

it O -
had O -
mysterious O -
peculiarities O -
which O -
corresponded O -
with O -
the O -
exceptional O -
nature O -
of O -
his O -
occupation O -
, O -
and O -
his O -
advent O -
from O -
an O -
unknown O -
region O -
called O -
" O -
North O -

So O -
had O -
his O -
way O -
of O -
life O -
: O -
-- O -
he O -
invited O -
no B-PER (76

to O -
step O -
across O -
his O -
door-sill O -
, O -
and O -
he O -
never O -

into O -
the O -

drink O -
a O -

the O -
Rainbow O -
, O -
or O -
to O -

at O -
the B-PER (78

: O -
he O -
sought O -
no B-PER (79

in O -

and O -
it O -
was O -
soon O -
clear O -
to O -
the O -
Raveloe O -
lasses O -
that O -
he O -
would O -
never O -
urge O -
one O -
of O -
them O -
to O -

him O -

This O -

not O -

, O -
the B-PER (117

, O -
averred O -
that O -
one O -
evening O -
as O -
he O -
was O -
returning O -
homeward O -
, O -
he O -
saw O -
Silas B-PER (37

leaning O -
against O -
a O -

with O -
a O -
heavy O -
bag O -
on O -
his O -
back O -
, O -
instead O -
of O -
resting O -
the O -

on O -
the O -
stile O -
as O -
a B-PER (85

in I-PER -
his I-PER (85)

would O -
have O -
done O -
; O -
and O -
that O -
, O -
on O -
coming O -
up O -
to O -
him O -
, O -
he O -
saw O -
that O -
Marner B-PER (37)
's O -
eyes O -
were O -
set O -
like O -
a B-PER (86
dead I-PER -
man I-PER 86)
's O -
, O -
and O -
he O -
spoke O -
to O -
him O -
, O -
and O -
shook O -
him O -
, O -
and O -
his O -
limbs O -
were O -
stiff O -
, O -
and O -
his O -
hands O -
clutched O -
the O -
bag O -
as O -
if O -
they O -
'd O -
been O -
made O -
of O -
iron O -
; O -
but O -
just O -
as O -
he O -
had O -
made O -
up O -
his O -
mind O -
that O -
the B-PER (37
weaver I-PER 37)
was O -
dead O -
, O -
he O -
came O -
all O -
right O -
again O -
, O -
like O -
, O -
as O -
you O -
might O -
say O -
, O -
in O -
the O -
winking O -
of O -
an O -
eye O -
, O -
and O -
said O -
" O -
Good-night O -
" O -
, O -
and O -
walked O -
off O -
. O -

All O -
this O -
Jem B-PER (84)
swore O -
he O -
had O -
seen O -
, O -
more O -
by O -
token O -
that O -
it O -
was O -
the O -
very O -
day O -
he O -
had O -
been O -
mole-catching O -
on O -
Squire B-PER (88|(89
Cass I-PER 88)
's O -
land O -
, O -
down O -
by O -
the O -
old O -
saw-pit O -
. O -

Some O -
said O -
Marner B-PER (37)
must O -
have O -
been O -
in O -
a O -
" O -
fit O -
" O -
, O -
a O -
word O -
which O -
seemed O -
to O -
explain O -
things O -
otherwise O -
incredible O -
; O -
but O -
the B-PER (91
argumentative I-PER -
Mr. I-PER -
Macey I-PER 91)
, O -
clerk O -
of O -
the O -
parish O -
, O -
shook O -
his O -
head O -
, O -
and O -
asked O -
if O -
anybody B-PER (93)
was O -
ever O -
known O -
to O -
go O -
off O -
in O -
a O -
fit O -
and O -
not O -
fall O -
down O -

A O -
fit O -
was O -
a O -
stroke O -
, O -
was O -
n't O -
it O -
? O -

and O -
it O -
was O -
in O -
the O -
nature O -
of O -
a O -
stroke O -
to O -
partly O -
take O -
away O -
the O -
use O -
of O -
a B-PER (94

's O -
limbs O -
and O -
throw O -
him O -
on O -
the O -
parish O -
, O -
if O -
he O -
'd O -
got O -
no B-PER (95

to O -
look O -
to O -
. O -

No O -
, O -
no O -
; O -
it O -
was O -
no O -
stroke O -
that O -
would O -
let O -
a B-PER (96
man I-PER 96)
stand O -
on O -
his O -
legs O -
, O -
like O -
a O -
horse O -
between O -
the O -

then O -
walk O -
off O -
as O -
soon O -
as O -
you O -
can O -
say O -
" O -
Gee O -

But O -
there O -
might O -
be O -
such O -
a O -
thing O -
as O -
a B-PER (98

that O -

how O -

he O -
fought O -

And O -
it O -
occurred O -
to O -

suddenly O -
that O -
I O -
would O -
visit O -

It O -
may O -
seem O -
strange O -
that O -
I O -

; O -
but O -
my B-PER (49|(4)

led O -

always O -
been O -

since O -
his O -
death O -
, O -
my O -

prompted O -

had O -
accepted O -
the B-PER (50

taught O -
that O -
a O -

But O -
the O -

A O -

, O -
and O -
one O -
evening O -
I O -
was O -
in O -
my O -

walking O -
up O -

down O -

thinking O -
, O -
when O -
there O -
was O -
a O -
ring O -
at O -
the O -

Going O -
down O -

I O -
opened O -

in O -
came O -

Sir B-PER (6

Captain B-PER (7

They O -
entered O -
the O -
vestibule O -
and O -
sat O -
themselves O -
down O -
before O -
the O -
wide O -
hearth O -
, O -
where O -
, O -
I O -
remember O -
, O -
a O -
particularly O -
good O -
fire O -
of O -

was O -
burning O -

‘ O -
It O -
is O -
very O -
kind O -
of O -

to O -

round O -

I O -
said O -
by O -
way O -
of O -
making O -
a O -

; O -
‘ O -
it O -
must O -
have O -
been O -
heavy O -

in O -
the O -

’ O -

They O -
said O -
nothing O -
, O -
but O -
Sir B-PER (6
Henry O -
slowly O -
filled O -
his O -
pipe O -
and O -
lit O -
it O -
with O -
a O -
burning O -
ember O -
. O -

As O -
he O -
leant O -
forward O -
to O -
do O -
so O -
the O -
fire O -
got O -
hold O -
of O -
a O -
gassy O -
bit O -
of O -
pine O -
and O -
flared O -
up O -
brightly O -
, O -
throwing O -
the O -
whole O -
scene O -
into O -
strong O -
relief O -
, O -
and O -
I O -
thought O -
, O -
What O -
a B-PER (6
splendid-looking I-PER -
man I-PER 6)
he O -
is O -
! O -

Calm O -
, O -

, O -
large O -
grey O -

altogether O -
a B-PER (6

the I-PER -
higher I-PER -
type I-PER -
of I-PER -
humanity I-PER 6)
. O -

Nor O -
did O -
his O -

belie O -
his O -
face O -
. O -

I O -
have O -
never O -
seen O -
wider O -
shoulders O -
or O -
a O -
deeper O -
chest O -
. O -

Indeed O -
, O -
Sir B-PER (6
Henry O -
’s O -
girth O -
is O -
so O -
great O -
that O -
, O -
though O -
he O -
is O -
six O -
feet O -

high O -
, O -
he O -
does O -
not O -
strike O -
one O -
as O -
a B-PER (9

. O -

As O -
I O -
looked O -
at O -
him O -
I O -
could O -
not O -
help O -
thinking O -
what O -
a O -
curious O -
contrast O -
my B-PER (2|(2)
little I-PER -
dried-up I-PER -

presented O -
to O -
his O -
grand O -

and O -

. O -

Imagine O -
to O -
yourself O -

and O -
you O -
will O -
get O -
a O -
very O -
fair O -
idea O -
of O -
Allan B-PER (2
Quatermain I-PER 2)
, O -
commonly O -
called O -
Hunter B-PER (2
Quatermain O -
, O -
or O -
by O -

Then O -
there O -
was O -
Good B-PER (7)
, O -
who O -
is O -
not O -
like O -
either O -
of O -
us O -
, O -
being O -
short O -

dark O -

stout O -

eyes O -

in O -
one O -
of O -
which O -
an O -

everlastingly O -
fixed O -
. O -

I O -
say O -
stout O -
, O -
but O -
it O -
is O -
a O -
mild O -
term O -
; O -
I O -
regret O -
to O -
state O -
that O -
of O -
late O -
years O -
Good B-PER (7)
has O -
been O -
running O -
to O -
fat O -
in O -
a O -
most O -
disgraceful O -
way O -
. O -

Sir B-PER (6
Henry O -
tells O -
him O -
that O -
it O -
comes O -
from O -
idleness O -
and O -
over-feeding O -
, O -
and O -
Good B-PER (7)
does O -
not O -
like O -
it O -
at O -
all O -
, O -
though O -
he O -
can O -
not O -
deny O -
it O -
. O -

We O -
sat O -
for O -
a O -
while O -
, O -
and O -
then O -
I O -
got O -
a O -
match O -
and O -
lit O -
the O -
lamp O -
that O -
stood O -
ready O -
on O -
the O -
table O -
, O -
for O -
the O -
half-light O -
began O -
to O -
grow O -
dreary O -
, O -
as O -
it O -
is O -
apt O -
to O -
do O -
when O -
one O -
has O -
a O -
short O -
week O -
ago O -
buried O -
the O -
hope O -
of O -
one O -
’s O -
life O -
. O -

Next O -
, O -
I O -
opened O -
a O -
cupboard O -
in O -
the O -
wainscoting O -
and O -
got O -
a O -
bottle O -
of O -
whisky O -
and O -
some O -
tumblers O -
and O -
water O -
. O -

I O -
always O -
like O -
to O -
do O -
these O -
things O -
for O -
myself O -
: O -
it O -
is O -
irritating O -
to O -
me O -
to O -
have O -
somebody B-PER (15)
continually O -
at O -
my O -
elbow O -
, O -
as O -
though O -
I O -
were O -
an B-PER (16
eighteen-month-old I-PER -
baby I-PER 16)
. O -

All O -
this O -
while O -
Curtis B-PER (6)
and O -
Good B-PER (7)
had O -
been O -
silent O -
, O -
feeling O -
, O -
I O -
suppose O -
, O -
that O -
they O -
had O -
nothing O -
to O -
say O -
that O -
could O -
do O -
me O -
any O -
good O -
, O -
and O -
content O -
to O -
give O -
me O -
the O -
comfort O -
of O -
their O -
presence O -
and O -
unspoken O -
sympathy O -
; O -
for O -
it O -
was O -
only O -
their O -
second O -
visit O -
since O -
the O -
funeral O -
. O -

And O -
it O -
is O -
, O -
by O -
the O -
way O -
, O -
from O -
the O -
_ O -
presence O -
_ O -
of O -
others O -
that O -
we O -
really O -
derive O -
support O -
in O -
our O -
dark O -
hours O -
of O -
grief O -
, O -
and O -
not O -
from O -
their O -
talk O -
, O -
which O -
often O -
only O -
serves O -
to O -
irritate O -
us O -
. O -

Before O -
a O -
bad O -
storm O -
the O -
game O -
always O -
herd O -
together O -
, O -
but O -
they O -
cease O -
their O -
calling O -
. O -

They O -
sat O -
and O -
smoked O -
and O -
drank O -
whisky O -
and O -
water O -
, O -
and O -
I O -
stood O -
by O -
the O -
fire O -
also O -
smoking O -
and O -
looking O -
at O -
them O -
. O -

At O -
last O -
I O -
spoke O -
. O -

‘ O -
Old B-PER (5

, O -
’ O -
I O -
said O -
, O -
‘ O -

‘ O -
Why O -
do O -
you O -
ask O -
? O -
’ O -

‘ O -
I O -
ask O -

I O -

had O -

I O -
am O -
going O -
back O -

’ O -

Sir B-PER (6

laid O -
his O -
head O -
back O -
in O -
his O -
arm-chair O -
and O -
laughed O -
one O -
of O -
his O -
deep O -

‘ O -
How O -
very O -

’ O -
he O -
said O -
, O -
‘ O -

’ O -

Good B-PER (7)
beamed O -
at O -
me O -
mysteriously O -
through O -
his O -
eyeglass O -
and O -
murmured O -
, O -
‘ O -
Yes O -

‘ O -

Sir B-PER (6

‘ O -

I O -
will O -
explain O -

As O -
Good B-PER (7)

I O -
were O -
walking O -
up O -

had O -
a O -

‘ O -
What O -

asked O -
Sir B-PER (6

I O -
shook O -
my O -
head O -

It O -
was O -
not O -
likely O -
that O -
I O -
should O -
know O -
what O -
Good B-PER (7)
might O -
be O -
talking O -
about O -

He O -
talks O -
about O -
so O -
many O -
things O -

‘ O -
Well O -

it O -
was O -
about O -

at O -
his O -

‘ O -

with O -
considerable O -

‘ O -
I O -

For O -
a O -

more O -
I O -
have O -
been O -
getting O -
as O -
restless O -
as O -
an O -

who O -

I O -
am O -

can O -
assure O -

have O -

the B-PER (46

up O -

got O -
but O -
a O -
glimpse O -
of O -
a O -
white O -
object O -
disappearing O -
behind O -
the O -
table O -
. O -

It O -
would O -
seem O -
he O -
was O -
picking O -
something O -
from O -
the O -
floor O -
. O -

She O -
rapped O -
down O -
the O -
mustard O -
pot O -
on O -
the O -
table O -
, O -
and O -
then O -
she O -
noticed O -
the O -
overcoat O -
and O -
hat O -
had O -
been O -
taken O -
off O -
and O -
put O -
over O -
a O -
chair O -
in O -
front O -
of O -
the O -
fire O -
, O -
and O -
a O -
pair O -
of O -
wet O -
boots O -
threatened O -
rust O -
to O -
her O -
steel O -
fender O -
. O -

She O -
went O -
to O -
these O -
things O -
resolutely O -
. O -

" O -
I O -
suppose O -
I O -
may O -
have O -
them O -
to O -
dry O -
now O -
, O -
" O -
she O -
said O -
in O -
a O -
voice O -
that O -
brooked O -
no O -
denial O -
. O -

" O -
Leave O -
the O -
hat O -
, O -
" O -
said O -
her B-PER (0|(6)
visitor I-PER 0)
, O -
in O -
a O -
muffled O -
voice O -
, O -
and O -
turning O -
she O -
saw O -
he O -
had O -
raised O -
his O -
head O -
and O -
was O -
sitting O -
and O -
looking O -
at O -
her O -
. O -

For O -
a O -
moment O -
she O -
stood O -
gaping O -
at O -
him O -
, O -
too O -
surprised O -
to O -
speak O -
. O -

He O -
held O -
a O -
white O -
cloth O -
-- O -
it O -
was O -
a O -
serviette O -
he O -
had O -
brought O -
with O -
him O -
-- O -
over O -
the O -
lower O -
part O -
of O -
his O -
face O -
, O -
so O -
that O -
his O -
mouth O -
and O -
jaws O -
were O -
completely O -
hidden O -
, O -
and O -
that O -
was O -
the O -
reason O -
of O -
his O -
muffled O -
voice O -
. O -

But O -
it O -
was O -
not O -
that O -
which O -
startled O -
Mrs. B-PER (6
Hall O -
. O -

It O -
was O -
the O -
fact O -
that O -
all O -
his O -
forehead O -
above O -
his O -
blue O -
glasses O -
was O -
covered O -
by O -
a O -
white O -
bandage O -
, O -
and O -
that O -
another O -
covered O -
his O -
ears O -
, O -
leaving O -
not O -
a O -
scrap O -
of O -
his O -
face O -
exposed O -
excepting O -
only O -
his O -
pink O -
, O -
peaked O -
nose O -
. O -

It O -
was O -
bright O -
, O -
pink O -
, O -
and O -
shiny O -
just O -
as O -
it O -
had O -
been O -
at O -
first O -
. O -

He O -
wore O -
a O -
dark-brown O -
velvet O -
jacket O -
with O -
a O -
high O -
, O -
black O -
, O -
linen-lined O -
collar O -
turned O -
up O -
about O -
his O -
neck O -
. O -

The O -
thick O -
black O -
hair O -
, O -
escaping O -
as O -
it O -
could O -
below O -
and O -
between O -
the O -
cross O -
bandages O -
, O -
projected O -
in O -
curious O -
tails O -
and O -
horns O -
, O -
giving O -
him O -
the O -
strangest O -
appearance O -
conceivable O -
. O -

This O -
muffled O -
and O -
bandaged O -
head O -
was O -
so O -
unlike O -
what O -
she O -
had O -
anticipated O -
, O -
that O -
for O -
a O -
moment O -
she O -
was O -
rigid O -
. O -

He O -
did O -
not O -
remove O -
the O -
serviette O -
, O -
but O -
remained O -
holding O -
it O -
, O -
as O -
she O -
saw O -
now O -
, O -
with O -
a O -
brown O -
gloved O -
hand O -
, O -
and O -
regarding O -
her O -
with O -
his O -
inscrutable O -
blue O -
glasses O -
. O -

" O -
Leave O -
the O -
hat O -
, O -
" O -
he O -
said O -
, O -
speaking O -
very O -
distinctly O -
through O -
the O -
white O -
cloth O -
. O -

Her O -
nerves O -
began O -
to O -
recover O -
from O -
the O -
shock O -
they O -
had O -
received O -
. O -

She O -
placed O -
the O -
hat O -
on O -
the O -
chair O -
again O -
by O -
the O -
fire O -
. O -

" O -
I O -
did O -
n't O -
know O -
, O -
sir B-PER (0)
, O -
" O -
she O -
began O -
, O -
" O -
that O -
-- O -
" O -
and O -
she O -
stopped O -
embarrassed O -
. O -

" O -
Thank O -
you O -
, O -
" O -
he O -
said O -
drily O -
, O -
glancing O -
from O -
her O -
to O -
the O -
door O -
and O -
then O -
at O -
her O -
again O -
. O -

" O -
I O -
'll O -
have O -
them O -
nicely O -
dried O -
, O -
sir B-PER (0)
, O -
at O -
once O -
, O -
" O -
she O -
said O -
, O -
and O -
carried O -
his O -
clothes O -
out O -
of O -
the O -
room O -
. O -

She O -
glanced O -
at O -
his O -
white-swathed O -
head O -
and O -
blue O -
goggles O -
again O -
as O -
she O -
was O -
going O -
out O -
of O -
the O -
door O -
; O -
but O -
his O -
napkin O -
was O -
still O -
in O -
front O -
of O -
his O -
face O -
. O -

She O -
shivered O -
a O -
little O -
as O -
she O -
closed O -
the O -
door O -
behind O -
her O -
, O -
and O -
her O -
face O -
was O -
eloquent O -
of O -
her O -
surprise O -
and O -
perplexity O -
. O -

" O -
I O -
_ O -
never O -
_ O -
, O -
" O -
she O -
whispered O -
. O -

" O -
There O -
! O -
" O -

She O -
went O -
quite O -
softly O -
to O -
the O -
kitchen O -
, O -
and O -
was O -
too O -
preoccupied O -
to O -
ask O -
Millie B-PER (13)
what O -
she O -
was O -
messing O -
about O -
with O -
_ O -
now O -
_ O -
, O -
when O -
she O -
got O -
there O -

The B-PER (0

sat O -
and O -
listened O -
to O -
her O -
retreating O -
feet O -
. O -

He O -
glanced O -
inquiringly O -
at O -
the O -
window O -
before O -
he O -
removed O -
his O -
serviette O -
, O -
and O -
resumed O -
his O -
meal O -

He O -
took O -
a O -
mouthful O -
, O -
glanced O -
suspiciously O -
at O -
the O -
window O -
, O -
took O -
another O -
mouthful O -
, O -
then O -
rose O -
and O -
, O -
taking O -
the O -
serviette O -
in O -
his O -

, O -
walked O -
across O -
the O -

pulled O -

the O -

I O -
had O -
two B-PER (10

or O -
mother B-PER (7)

what O -
became O -
of O -
me O -
. O -

Being O -
the B-PER (51

the I-PER -
family I-PER 51)
and O -
not O -
bred O -
to O -
any O -

, O -
my O -
head O -
began O -
to O -
be O -
filled O -
very O -
early O -
with O -
rambling O -
thoughts O -

My B-PER (4|(0)
father I-PER -

who I-PER -
was I-PER -
very I-PER -
ancient I-PER 4)

had O -
given O -
me O -
a O -
competent O -
share O -
of O -
learning O -
, O -
as O -
far O -
as O -
house-education O -
and O -
a O -
country O -
free O -
school O -
generally O -
go O -
, O -
and O -
designed O -
me O -
for O -
the O -
law O -
; O -
but O -
I O -
would O -
be O -
satisfied O -
with O -
nothing O -
but O -
going O -
to O -
sea O -
; O -
and O -
my O -
inclination O -
to O -
this O -
led O -
me O -
so O -
strongly O -
against O -
the O -
will O -
, O -
nay O -
, O -
the O -
commands O -
of O -
my B-PER (4|(0)
father I-PER 4)
, O -
and O -
against O -
all O -
the O -
entreaties O -
and O -
persuasions O -
of O -
my B-PER (7|(0)
mother I-PER 7)
and O -
other O -
friends B-PER (20)
, O -
that O -
there O -
seemed O -
to O -
be O -
something O -
fatal O -
in O -
that O -
propensity O -
of O -
nature O -
, O -
tending O -
directly O -
to O -
the O -
life O -

a B-PER (52

gave O -
me O -
serious O -
and O -
excellent O -
counsel O -
against O -
what O -
he O -
foresaw O -
was O -
my O -
design O -

He O -
called O -
me O -
one O -

into O -
his O -
chamber O -

where O -
he O -
was O -
confined O -
by O -
the O -

expostulated O -
very O -
warmly O -
with O -
me O -
upon O -
this O -

asked O -
me O -

God B-PER (36)

I O -
observed O -
in O -
this O -
last O -
part O -
of O -
his O -
discourse O -
, O -
which O -
was O -
truly O -
prophetic O -
, O -
though O -
I O -
suppose O -
my B-PER (4|(0)

did O -
not O -
know O -
it O -
to O -

so O -
himself O -
— O -
I O -
say O -
, O -
I O -
observed O -
the O -
tears O -
run O -
down O -
his O -
face O -
very O -
plentifully O -
, O -
especially O -
when O -
he O -
spoke O -
of O -
my B-PER (11|(0)
brother I-PER -
who I-PER -
was I-PER -
killed I-PER 11)
: O -
and O -
that O -
when O -
he O -
spoke O -
of O -
my O -
having O -
leisure O -
to O -
repent O -
, O -
and O -
none O -
to O -
assist O -
me O -
, O -
he O -
was O -
so O -
moved O -
that O -
he O -
broke O -
off O -
the O -
discourse O -
, O -
and O -
told O -
me O -
his O -
heart O -
was O -
so O -
full O -
he O -
could O -
say O -
no O -
more O -
to O -
me O -

I O -
was O -
sincerely O -
affected O -
with O -
this O -
discourse O -
, O -
and O -
, O -
indeed O -
, O -
who O -
could O -
be O -
otherwise O -
? O -

and O -
I O -
resolved O -
not O -
to O -
think O -
of O -
going O -
abroad O -
any O -
more O -
, O -
but O -
to O -
settle O -
at O -

according O -

my B-PER (4|(0)

desire O -
. O -

But O -
alas O -
! O -

a O -
few O -
days O -
wore O -
it O -
all O -
off O -
; O -
and O -
, O -
in O -
short O -
, O -
to O -
prevent O -
any O -

my B-PER (4|(0)

’s O -
further O -
importunities O -
, O -
in O -
a O -
few O -

run O -

, O -
I O -
did O -
not O -
act O -
quite O -
so O -
hastily O -
as O -
the O -
first O -
heat O -
of O -
my O -
resolution O -
prompted O -
; O -
but O -
I O -
took O -
my B-PER (7|(0)
mother I-PER 7)
at O -
a O -
time O -
when O -
I O -
thought O -
her O -
a O -
little O -
more O -
pleasant O -
than O -
ordinary O -
, O -
and O -
told O -
her O -
that O -
my O -

were O -
so O -
entirely O -
bent O -

the O -

that O -
I O -
should O -
never O -
settle O -

anything O -
with O -
resolution O -
enough O -
to O -
go O -
through O -

it O -
, O -
and O -
my B-PER (4|(0)

had O -
better O -
give O -
me O -
his O -
consent O -
than O -
force O -
me O -
to O -
go O -
without O -
it O -
; O -
that O -
I O -

now O -
eighteen O -

an B-PER (37

that O -
I O -

sure O -

I O -
did O -
I O -
should O -
never O -
serve O -

run O -

my B-PER (38|(0)

my O -

was O -
out O -

to O -
let O -
me O -
go O -

I O -

did O -
not O -

I O -

to O -
recover O -
the O -

put O -
my B-PER (7|(0)

into O -
a O -
great O -
passion O -

told O -
me O -

such O -

I O -

there O -
was O -
no O -

I O -

I O -
had O -
found O -

the O -

faintly O -
and O -
evenly O -
. O -

If O -
he O -

I O -

I O -
would O -
see O -
the O -
reflection O -

I O -

at O -
the O -

of O -
a B-PER (4

He O -
had O -
often O -
said O -

me O -
: O -
“ O -
I O -

for O -
this O -

I O -
had O -
thought O -
his O -

Now O -
I O -

true O -

Every O -

I O -

up O -

I O -
said O -
softly O -
to O -

the O -
word O -

It O -
had O -
always O -
sounded O -
strangely O -
in O -
my O -
ears O -
, O -
like O -
the O -
word O -
gnomon O -
in O -
the O -
Euclid B-PER (6)

the O -
word O -
simony O -

But O -
now O -
it O -
sounded O -
to O -
me O -
like O -
the O -
name O -
of O -
some B-PER (7

It O -
filled O -

yet O -
I O -
longed O -

be O -
nearer O -
to O -
it O -

to O -
look O -
upon O -
its O -
deadly O -
work O -

Old B-PER (8

When O -
we O -
knew O -
him O -

he O -
used O -
to O -
be O -
rather O -
interesting O -
, O -
talking O -
of O -

worms O -
; O -
but O -
I O -
soon O -
grew O -
tired O -

his O -

about O -

“ O -

it O -

his O -

My B-PER (13|(2)

the O -

My B-PER (13|(2)

“ O -

“ O -

my B-PER (10|(2)

piously O -
. O -

Old B-PER (8
Cotter I-PER 8)
looked O -
at O -
me O -
for O -
a O -
while O -

I O -
felt O -
that O -
his O -
little O -
beady O -

were O -
examining O -
me O -
but O -
I O -
would O -
not O -
satisfy O -
him O -
by O -
looking O -
up O -
from O -
my O -

He O -
returned O -
to O -
his O -

finally O -
spat O -
rudely O -
into O -
the O -

“ O -
I O -

Tiresome B-PER (8

! O -

It O -
was O -
late O -
when O -
I O -
fell O -
asleep O -
. O -

Though O -
I O -
was O -
angry O -
with O -
old B-PER (8
Cotter I-PER 8)
for O -
alluding O -
to O -
me O -
as O -
a B-PER (56
child I-PER 56)
, O -
I O -
puzzled O -
my O -
head O -
to O -
extract O -

from O -
his O -
unfinished O -
sentences O -
. O -

In O -
the O -
dark O -
of O -
my O -
room O -
I O -
imagined O -
that O -
I O -
saw O -
again O -
the O -
heavy O -
grey O -
face O -
of O -
the B-PER (1
paralytic I-PER 1)

I O -
drew O -
the O -
blankets O -
over O -
my O -
head O -
and O -
tried O -
to O -
think O -
of O -
Christmas O -
. O -

But O -
the O -
grey O -
face O -
still O -
followed O -
me O -
. O -

It O -
murmured O -
; O -
and O -
I O -
understood O -
that O -
it O -
desired O -
to O -
confess O -
something O -
. O -

I O -
felt O -
my O -
soul O -
receding O -
into O -
some O -
pleasant O -

vicious O -
region O -
; O -
and O -
there O -
again O -
I O -
found O -
it O -
waiting O -
for O -
me O -

It O -
began O -
to O -
confess O -
to O -
me O -
in O -
a O -
murmuring O -
voice O -
and O -
I O -
wondered O -
why O -
it O -
smiled O -
continually O -
and O -
why O -
the O -
lips O -
were O -
so O -
moist O -
with O -
spittle O -
. O -

But O -
then O -
I O -
remembered O -
that O -
it O -
had O -
died O -
of O -
paralysis O -
and O -
I O -
felt O -
that O -
I O -
too O -
was O -
smiling O -
feebly O -
as O -
if O -
to O -
absolve O -
the B-PER (1

The O -

The O -
reading O -
of O -
the O -
card O -
persuaded O -
me O -
that O -
he O -
was O -
dead O -
and O -
I O -
was O -
disturbed O -
to O -
find O -
myself O -
at O -
check O -
. O -

Had O -
he O -
not O -
been O -
dead O -
I O -
would O -
have O -
gone O -
into O -
the O -
little O -
dark O -
room O -
behind O -
the O -
shop O -
to O -
find O -
him O -
sitting O -
in O -
his O -
arm-chair O -
by O -
the O -
fire O -
, O -
nearly O -
smothered O -
in O -
his O -
great-coat O -
. O -

Perhaps O -
my B-PER (10|(2)
aunt I-PER 10)
would O -
have O -
given O -
me O -
a O -
packet O -
of O -
High O -
Toast O -
for O -
him O -
and O -
this O -
present O -
would O -
have O -
roused O -
him O -
from O -
his O -
stupefied O -
doze O -
. O -

It O -
was O -
always O -
I O -
who O -
emptied O -
the O -
packet O -
into O -
his O -
black O -
snuff-box O -
for O -
his O -
hands O -
trembled O -
too O -
much O -
to O -
allow O -
him O -
to O -
do O -
this O -
without O -
spilling O -
half O -
the O -
snuff O -
about O -
the O -
floor O -
. O -

Even O -
as O -
he O -
raised O -
his O -
large O -
trembling O -
hand O -
to O -
his O -
nose O -
little O -
clouds O -
of O -
smoke O -
dribbled O -
through O -
his O -
fingers O -
over O -
the O -
front O -
of O -
his O -
coat O -
. O -

It O -
may O -
have O -
been O -
these O -
constant O -
showers O -
of O -
snuff O -
which O -
gave O -
his O -
ancient O -
priestly O -
garments O -
their O -
green O -
faded O -
look O -
for O -
the O -
red O -
handkerchief O -
, O -
blackened O -
, O -
as O -
it O -
always O -
was O -
, O -
with O -
the O -
snuff-stains O -
of O -
a O -
week O -
, O -
with O -
which O -
he O -
tried O -
to O -
brush O -
away O -
the O -
fallen O -
grains O -
, O -
was O -
quite O -
inefficacious O -
. O -

I O -
wished O -
to O -
go O -
in O -
and O -
look O -
at O -
him O -
but O -
I O -
had O -
not O -
the O -
courage O -
to O -
knock O -
. O -

I O -
walked O -
away O -
slowly O -
along O -
the O -
sunny O -
side O -
of O -
the O -
street O -
, O -
reading O -
all O -
the O -
theatrical O -
advertisements O -
in O -
the O -
shop-windows O -
as O -
I O -
went O -
. O -

I O -
found O -
it O -
strange O -
that O -
neither O -
I O -
nor O -
the O -
day O -
seemed O -
in O -
a O -
mourning O -
mood O -
and O -
I O -
felt O -
even O -
annoyed O -
at O -
discovering O -
in O -
myself O -
a O -
sensation O -
of O -
freedom O -
as O -
if O -
I O -
had O -
been O -
freed O -
from O -
something O -
by O -
his O -
death O -
. O -

I O -
wondered O -
at O -
this O -
for O -
, O -
as O -
my B-PER (13|(2)
uncle I-PER 13)
had O -
said O -
the O -
night O -
before O -
, O -
he O -
had O -
taught O -
me O -
a O -
great O -
deal O -
. O -

He O -
had O -
studied O -
in O -
the O -
Irish O -
college O -
in O -
Rome O -
and O -
he O -
had O -
taught O -
me O -
to O -
pronounce O -
Latin O -
properly O -
. O -

He O -
had O -
told O -
me O -
stories O -
about O -
the O -
catacombs O -
and O -
about O -
Napoleon B-PER (38
Bonaparte I-PER 38)
, O -
and O -
he O -
had O -
explained O -
to O -
me O -
the O -
meaning O -
of O -
the O -
different O -
ceremonies O -
of O -
the O -
Mass O -
and O -
of O -
the O -
different O -
vestments O -
worn O -
by O -
the B-PER (39
priest I-PER 39)
. O -

Sometimes O -
he O -
had O -
amused O -
himself O -
by O -
putting O -
difficult O -
questions O -
to O -
me O -
, O -
asking O -
me O -
what O -
one O -
should O -
do O -
in O -
certain O -
circumstances O -
or O -
whether O -
such O -
and O -
such O -
sins O -
were O -
mortal O -
or O -
venial O -
or O -
only O -
imperfections O -
. O -

His O -
questions O -
showed O -
me O -
how O -
complex O -
and O -
mysterious O -
were O -
certain O -
institutions O -
of O -
the O -
Church O -
which O -
I O -
had O -
always O -
regarded O -
as O -
the O -
simplest O -
acts O -
. O -

The O -
duties O -
of O -
the B-PER (41
priest I-PER 41)
towards O -
the O -
Eucharist O -
and O -
towards O -
the O -
secrecy O -
of O -
the O -
confessional O -
seemed O -
so O -
grave O -
to O -
me O -
that O -
I O -
wondered O -
how O -
anybody B-PER (42)
had O -
ever O -
found O -
in O -
himself O -
the O -
courage O -
to O -
undertake O -
them O -
; O -
and O -
I O -
was O -
not O -
surprised O -
when O -
he O -
told O -
me O -
that O -
the O -
fathers O -
of O -
the O -
Church O -
had O -
written O -
books O -
as O -
thick O -
as O -
the O -
Post O -
Office O -
Directory O -
and O -
as O -
closely O -
printed O -
as O -
the O -
law O -
notices O -
in O -
the O -
newspaper O -
, O -
elucidating O -
all O -
these O -
intricate O -
questions O -
. O -

Often O -
when O -
I O -
thought O -
of O -
this O -
I O -
could O -
make O -
no O -
answer O -
or O -
only O -
a O -
very O -
foolish O -
and O -
halting O -
one O -
upon O -
which O -
he O -
used O -
to O -
smile O -
and O -
nod O -
his O -
head O -
twice O -
or O -
thrice O -
. O -

Sometimes O -
he O -
used O -
to O -
put O -
me O -
through O -
the O -
responses O -
of O -
the O -
Mass O -
which O -
he O -
had O -
made O -
me O -
learn O -
by O -
heart O -
; O -
and O -
, O -
as O -
I O -
pattered O -
, O -
he O -
used O -
to O -
smile O -
pensively O -
and O -
nod O -
his O -
head O -
, O -
now O -
and O -
then O -
pushing O -
huge O -
pinches O -
of O -
snuff O -
up O -
each O -
nostril O -
alternately O -
. O -

When O -
he O -
smiled O -
he O -
used O -
to O -
uncover O -
his O -
big O -
discoloured O -
teeth O -
and O -
let O -
his O -
tongue O -
lie O -
upon O -
his O -
lower O -
lip O -
— O -
a O -
habit O -
which O -
had O -
made O -
me O -
feel O -
uneasy O -
in O -
the O -
beginning O -
of O -
our O -
acquaintance O -
before O -
I O -
knew O -
him O -
well O -
. O -

As O -
I O -
walked O -
along O -
in O -
the O -
sun O -
I O -
remembered O -
old B-PER (8
Cotter I-PER 8)
’s O -
words O -
and O -
tried O -
to O -
remember O -
what O -
had O -
happened O -
afterwards O -
in O -
the O -
dream O -
. O -

I O -
remembered O -
that O -
I O -
had O -
noticed O -
long O -
velvet O -
curtains O -
and O -
a O -
swinging O -
lamp O -
of O -
antique O -
fashion O -
. O -

I O -
felt O -
that O -
I O -
had O -
been O -
very O -
far O -
away O -
, O -
in O -
some O -
land O -
where O -
the O -
customs O -
were O -
strange O -
— O -
in O -
Persia O -
, O -
I O -
thought O -
... O -
. O -

But O -
I O -
could O -
not O -
remember O -
the O -
end O -
of O -
the O -
dream O -
. O -

In O -
the O -
evening O -
my B-PER (10|(2)
aunt I-PER 10)
took O -
me O -
with O -
her O -
to O -
visit O -
the O -
house O -
of O -
mourning O -
. O -

It O -
was O -
after O -
sunset O -
; O -
but O -
the O -
window-panes O -
of O -
the O -
houses O -
that O -
looked O -
to O -
the O -
west O -
reflected O -
the O -
tawny O -
gold O -
of O -
a O -
great O -
bank O -
of O -
clouds O -
. O -

Nannie B-PER (50)
received O -
us O -
in O -
the O -
hall O -
; O -
and O -
, O -
as O -
it O -
would O -
have O -
been O -
unseemly O -
to O -
have O -
shouted O -
at O -
her O -
, O -
my B-PER (10|(2)
aunt I-PER 10)
shook O -
hands O -
with O -
her O -
for O -
all O -
. O -

The B-PER (50
old I-PER -
woman I-PER 50)
pointed O -
upwards O -
interrogatively O -
and O -
, O -
on O -
my B-PER (10|(2)
aunt I-PER 10)
’s O -
nodding O -
, O -
proceeded O -
to O -
toil O -
up O -
the O -
narrow O -
staircase O -
before O -
us O -
, O -
her O -
bowed O -
head O -
being O -
scarcely O -
above O -
the O -
level O -
of O -
the O -
banister-rail O -
. O -

At O -
the O -
first O -
landing O -
she O -
stopped O -
and O -
beckoned O -
us O -
forward O -
encouragingly O -
towards O -
the O -
open O -
door O -
of O -
the O -
dead-room O -
. O -

My B-PER (10|(2)
aunt I-PER 10)
went O -
in O -
and O -
the B-PER (50
old I-PER -
woman I-PER 50)
, O -
seeing O -
that O -
I O -
hesitated O -
to O -
enter O -
, O -
began O -
to O -
beckon O -
to O -
me O -
again O -
repeatedly O -
with O -
her O -
hand O -

heard O -
him O -
tell O -
Peter B-PER (32

the O -
evening O -
before O -

William B-PER (33|(34

him O -

of O -

never O -

volunteer O -
information O -
about O -
anything O -
in O -
his O -
whole O -
life O -

And O -
yet O -
here O -
was O -
Matthew B-PER (29

, O -
at O -
half-past O -
three O -
on O -
the O -
afternoon O -
of O -
a O -
busy O -
day O -

placidly O -
driving O -
over O -
the O -
hollow O -

up O -
the O -
hill O -
; O -
moreover O -
, O -
he O -
wore O -
a O -
white O -
collar O -
and O -
his O -
best O -
suit O -
of O -
clothes O -
, O -
which O -
was O -
plain O -
proof O -
that O -
he O -
was O -
going O -
out O -
of O -
Avonlea O -
; O -
and O -
he O -
had O -
the O -
buggy O -
and O -
the O -
sorrel O -
mare O -
, O -
which O -
betokened O -
that O -
he O -
was O -
going O -

considerable O -
distance O -

Now O -
, O -
where O -
was O -
Matthew B-PER (29

going O -
and O -
why O -
was O -
he O -
going O -
there O -
? O -

Had O -
it O -

might O -

pretty O -
good O -

to O -
both O -
questions O -

But O -
Matthew B-PER (29)
so O -
rarely O -
went O -
from O -
home O -
that O -
it O -
must O -
be O -
something O -
pressing O -

unusual O -
which O -
was O -
taking O -

As O -
the O -
doctor O -
in O -
New O -
England O -

is O -
proverbially O -
old O -
, O -
so O -
the O -

He O -

, O -
for O -
that O -
part O -
of O -
the O -
world O -
, O -
at O -

. O -

There O -

something O -
individual O -
in O -
the O -

in O -
which O -
his O -
reddish-brown O -

His O -

a O -
curly O -
, O -
reddish O -
mustache O -
and O -
an O -
imperial O -
, O -
cut O -
trimly O -
, O -
which O -
made O -
him O -
look O -
a O -
little O -
like O -
the O -
pictures O -
of O -
Napoleon B-PER (21
III I-PER 21)
. O -

His O -
hands O -
were O -
large O -
and O -
well O -
kept O -
, O -
but O -
ruggedly O -
formed O -
, O -
and O -
the O -
backs O -
were O -
shaded O -
with O -
crinkly O -
reddish O -

. O -

He O -
wore O -
a O -
blue O -

of O -

the B-PER (3

had O -
known O -
at O -
a O -
glance O -
that O -
it O -
was O -
made O -
by O -
a O -
Denver O -
tailor O -
. O -

The B-PER (1
doctor I-PER 1)
was O -
always O -
well O -
dressed O -
. O -

Dr. B-PER (1
Archie O -
turned O -
up O -
the B-PER -
student I-PER -
's O -
lamp O -
and O -
sat O -
down O -
in O -
the O -
swivel O -
chair O -
before O -
his O -
desk O -
. O -

He O -
sat O -
uneasily O -
, O -
beating O -
a O -
tattoo O -
on O -
his O -
knees O -
with O -
his O -
fingers O -
, O -
and O -
looked O -
about O -
him O -
as O -
if O -
he O -
were O -
bored O -
. O -

He O -
glanced O -
at O -
his O -
watch O -
, O -
then O -
absently O -
took O -
from O -
his O -
pocket O -
a O -
bunch O -
of O -
small O -
keys O -
, O -
selected O -
one O -
and O -
looked O -
at O -
it O -
. O -

A O -
contemptuous O -
smile O -
, O -
barely O -
perceptible O -
, O -
played O -
on O -
his O -
lips O -
, O -
but O -
his O -
eyes O -
remained O -
meditative O -
. O -

Behind O -
the O -
door O -
that O -
led O -
into O -
the O -
hall O -
, O -
under O -
his O -
buffalo-skin O -
driving-coat O -
, O -
was O -
a O -

. O -

This O -
the B-PER (1

opened O -
mechanically O -
, O -
kicking O -
aside O -
a O -
pile O -
of O -
muddy O -
overshoes O -
. O -

Inside O -

Hearing O -
a O -

in O -
the O -
empty O -
, O -
echoing O -

without O -
, O -
the B-PER (1

closed O -
the O -

again O -
, O -
snapping O -

Yale O -

The O -

a B-PER (25

the O -
consulting-room O -
. O -

“ O -
Good-evening O -
, O -
Mr. B-PER (25

” O -
said O -
the B-PER (1
doctor I-PER 1)
carelessly O -
. O -

“ O -
Sit O -
down O -
. O -
” O -

His B-PER (25|(1)
visitor I-PER 25)
was O -
a B-PER (77

He O -

, O -
a O -
white O -

, O -
and O -
steel O -
rimmed O -
spectacles O -
. O -

Altogether O -
there O -
was O -
a O -
pretentious O -
and O -
important O -
air O -
about O -
him O -
, O -
as O -
he O -
lifted O -
the O -
skirts O -
of O -
his O -
coat O -
and O -
sat O -
down O -
. O -

“ O -
Good-evening O -
, O -
doctor B-PER (1)
. O -

Can O -
you O -
step O -
around O -
to O -
the O -
house O -

? O -

I O -
think O -
Mrs. B-PER (28
Kronborg O -
will O -
need O -
you O -
this O -
evening O -
. O -
” O -

This O -
was O -
said O -
with O -
profound O -
gravity O -
and O -
, O -
curiously O -
enough O -
, O -
with O -
a O -
slight O -
embarrassment O -
. O -

“ O -
Any O -
hurry O -
? O -
” O -
the B-PER (1
doctor I-PER 1)
asked O -
over O -
his O -
shoulder O -
as O -
he O -
went O -
into O -
his O -
operating-room O -
. O -

Mr. B-PER (25
Kronborg O -
coughed O -
behind O -
his O -
hand O -
, O -
and O -
contracted O -
his O -
brows O -
. O -

His O -
face O -
threatened O -
at O -
every O -
moment O -
to O -
break O -
into O -
a O -
smile O -
of O -
foolish O -
excitement O -
. O -

He O -
controlled O -
it O -
only O -
by O -
calling O -
upon O -
his O -
habitual O -
pulpit O -
manner O -
. O -

“ O -
Well O -
, O -
I O -
think O -
it O -
would O -
be O -
as O -

to O -

immediately O -

Mrs. B-PER (28
Kronborg O -
will O -
be O -
more O -
comfortable O -
if O -
you O -

there O -
. O -

She O -
has O -
been O -
suffering O -
for O -
some O -
time O -

” O -

The B-PER (1
doctor I-PER 1)
came O -
back O -
and O -
threw O -
a O -
black O -
bag O -
upon O -
his O -
desk O -
. O -

He O -
wrote O -
some O -
instructions O -
for O -
his B-PER (8|(1)
man I-PER 8)
on O -
a O -
prescription O -
pad O -
and O -
then O -
drew O -
on O -
his O -
overcoat O -
. O -

“ O -
All O -
ready O -
, O -
” O -
he O -
announced O -
, O -
putting O -
out O -
his O -
lamp O -
. O -

Mr. B-PER (25
Kronborg O -
rose O -
and O -
they O -
tramped O -
through O -
the O -
empty O -
hall O -
and O -
down O -
the O -
stairway O -
to O -
the O -
street O -
. O -

The O -
drug O -
store O -
below O -
was O -
dark O -
, O -
and O -
the O -
saloon O -
next O -
door O -
was O -
just O -
closing O -
. O -

Every O -
other O -
light O -
on O -
Main O -
Street O -
was O -
out O -
. O -

On O -
either O -
side O -
of O -
the O -
road O -
and O -
at O -
the O -
outer O -
edge O -
of O -
the O -
board O -
sidewalk O -
, O -
the O -
snow O -
had O -
been O -
shoveled O -
into O -
breastworks O -
. O -

The O -
town O -
looked O -
small O -
and O -
black O -
, O -
flattened O -
down O -
in O -
the O -
snow O -
, O -
muffled O -
and O -
all O -
but O -
extinguished O -
. O -

Overhead O -
the O -
stars O -
shone O -
gloriously O -
. O -

It O -
was O -
impossible O -
not O -
to O -
notice O -
them O -
. O -

The O -
air O -
was O -
so O -
clear O -
that O -
the O -
white O -
sand O -
hills O -
to O -
the O -
east O -
of O -
Moonstone O -
gleamed O -
softly O -
. O -

Following O -
the B-PER (25
Reverend I-PER 25)
Mr. B-PER (25
Kronborg O -
along O -
the O -
narrow O -
walk O -
, O -
past O -
the O -
little O -
dark O -
, O -
sleeping O -
houses O -
, O -
the B-PER (1
doctor I-PER 1)
looked O -
up O -
at O -
the O -
flashing O -
night O -
and O -
whistled O -
softly O -
. O -

It O -
did O -
seem O -
that O -
people B-PER (40)
were O -
stupider O -
than O -
they O -
need O -
be O -
; O -
as O -
if O -
on O -
a O -
night O -
like O -
this O -
there O -
ought O -
to O -
be O -
something O -
better O -
to O -
do O -
than O -
to O -
sleep O -
nine O -
hours O -
, O -
or O -
to O -
assist O -
Mrs. B-PER (28
Kronborg O -
in O -
functions O -
which O -
she O -
could O -
have O -
performed O -
so O -
admirably O -
unaided O -
. O -

He O -
wished O -
he O -
had O -
gone O -
down O -
to O -
Denver O -
to O -
hear O -
Fay B-PER (41
Templeton I-PER 41)
sing O -
“ O -

Then O -
he O -
remembered O -
that O -
he O -
had O -
a O -
personal O -
interest O -
in O -
this B-PER (42
family I-PER 42)
, O -
after O -
all O -
. O -

They O -
turned O -
into O -
another O -

and O -
saw O -
before O -

As O -

Peter B-PER (25
Kronborg I-PER 25)
's O -
pace O -
grew O -
brisker O -
. O -

His O -
nervous O -
, O -
ministerial O -
cough O -
annoyed O -
the B-PER (1

. O -

“ O -
Exactly O -

going O -
to O -

he O -
thought O -

He O -
drew O -
off O -

felt O -

“ O -

The O -

A O -

it O -

The O -
difficulty O -
was O -
, O -
he O -
was O -
apt O -
to O -
be O -
altogether O -
too O -
energetic O -
. O -

There O -
was O -
a O -
strange O -
, O -
inflamed O -
, O -
flurried O -
, O -
flighty O -
recklessness O -
of O -
activity O -
about O -
him O -

He O -
would O -
be O -
incautious O -
in O -
dipping O -
his O -
pen O -
into O -
his O -
inkstand O -

All O -
his O -
blots O -
upon O -
my O -
documents O -

were O -
dropped O -
there O -
after O -
twelve O -
o'clock O -

Indeed O -
, O -
not O -
only O -
would O -
he O -
be O -
reckless O -
and O -
sadly O -
given O -
to O -
making O -
blots O -
in O -
the O -
afternoon O -
, O -
but O -
some O -
days O -
he O -
went O -
further O -
, O -
and O -
was O -
rather O -
noisy O -
. O -

At O -
such O -
times O -
, O -
too O -
, O -
his O -
face O -
flamed O -
with O -
augmented O -
blazonry O -
, O -
as O -
if O -
cannel O -

had O -
been O -
heaped O -
on O -

He O -
made O -
an O -
unpleasant O -
racket O -
with O -
his O -
chair O -
; O -
spilled O -
his O -
sand-box O -
; O -
in O -
mending O -
his O -

, O -
impatiently O -
split O -
them O -
all O -
to O -
pieces O -
, O -
and O -
threw O -
them O -
on O -
the O -
floor O -
in O -
a O -
sudden O -
passion O -
; O -
stood O -
up O -
and O -
leaned O -
over O -
his O -
table O -
, O -
boxing O -
his O -
papers O -
about O -

a O -
most O -
indecorous O -

very O -

to O -

an B-PER (33

. O -

Nevertheless O -
, O -
as O -
he O -
was O -
in O -
many O -
ways O -
a B-PER (64

indeed O -

I O -

I O -
did O -
this O -
very O -

in O -
the O -

being O -
a B-PER (56

one O -

( O -

to O -

him O -

very O -

But O -
no O -

upon O -
his O -

His O -

all O -

I O -

I O -
made O -
up O -
my O -

I O -
always O -
deemed O -
him O -
the O -
victim O -
of O -
two O -
evil O -
powers O -
-- O -
ambition O -
and O -
indigestion O -
. O -

The O -
ambition O -
was O -
evinced O -
by O -
a O -
certain O -
impatience O -
of O -
the O -
duties O -
of O -
a B-PER (39
mere I-PER -
copyist I-PER 39)
, O -
an O -
unwarrantable O -
usurpation O -
of O -

professional O -
affairs O -
, O -
such O -
as O -
the O -
original O -
drawing O -
up O -
of O -

The O -
indigestion O -
seemed O -
betokened O -
in O -
an O -
occasional O -
nervous O -
testiness O -
and O -
grinning O -
irritability O -
, O -
causing O -
the O -
teeth O -
to O -
audibly O -
grind O -
together O -
over O -
mistakes O -
committed O -
in O -
copying O -
; O -
unnecessary O -
maledictions O -
, O -
hissed O -
, O -
rather O -
than O -
spoken O -
, O -
in O -
the O -
heat O -
of O -
business O -
; O -
and O -
especially O -
by O -
a O -
continual O -
discontent O -
with O -
the O -
height O -
of O -
the O -
table O -
where O -
he O -
worked O -
. O -

Though O -
of O -
a O -
very O -
ingenious O -
mechanical O -
turn O -
, O -
Nippers B-PER (29)
could O -
never O -
get O -
this O -
table O -
to O -
suit O -
him O -
. O -

He O -
put O -
chips O -
under O -
it O -
, O -
blocks O -
of O -
various O -
sorts O -
, O -
bits O -
of O -
pasteboard O -
, O -
and O -
at O -
last O -
went O -
so O -
far O -
as O -
to O -
attempt O -
an O -
exquisite O -
adjustment O -
by O -
final O -
pieces O -
of O -
folded O -
blotting O -
paper O -
. O -

But O -
no O -
invention O -
would O -
answer O -
. O -

If O -
, O -
for O -
the O -
sake O -
of O -
easing O -
his O -
back O -
, O -
he O -
brought O -
the O -
table O -
lid O -
at O -
a O -
sharp O -
angle O -
well O -
up O -
towards O -
his O -
chin O -
, O -
and O -
wrote O -
there O -
like O -
a O -
man O -
using O -
the O -
steep O -
roof O -
of O -
a O -
Dutch O -
house O -
for O -
his O -
desk O -
: O -
-- O -
then O -
he O -
declared O -
that O -
it O -
stopped O -
the O -
circulation O -
in O -
his O -
arms O -
. O -

If O -
now O -
he O -
lowered O -
the O -
table O -
to O -
his O -
waistbands O -
, O -
and O -
stooped O -
over O -
it O -
in O -
writing O -
, O -
then O -
there O -
was O -
a O -
sore O -
aching O -
in O -
his O -

In O -
short O -
, O -
the O -
truth O -
of O -
the O -
matter O -
was O -
, O -
Nippers B-PER (29)
knew O -
not O -
what O -
he O -
wanted O -

, O -
if O -

it O -
was O -
to O -
be O -
rid O -
of O -
a O -
scrivener O -
's O -
table O -
altogether O -
. O -

Among O -
the O -
manifestations O -
of O -
his O -
diseased O -
ambition O -
was O -
a O -
fondness O -
he O -
had O -
for O -
receiving O -
visits O -
from O -
certain O -
ambiguous-looking O -
fellows O -
in O -
seedy O -
coats O -
, O -
whom O -
he O -
called O -
his B-PER (42|(29)

. O -

Indeed O -
I O -
was O -
aware O -
that O -
not O -
only O -
was O -
he O -
, O -
at O -
times O -
, O -
considerable O -
of O -
a B-PER (43
ward-politician I-PER 43)
, O -
but O -
he O -
occasionally O -
did O -
a O -
little O -
business O -
at O -
the B-PER (44|(45
Justices I-PER 44)
' O -

, O -
and O -
was O -
not O -
unknown O -
on O -
the O -
steps O -
of O -
the O -

. O -

I O -
have O -
good O -
reason O -
to O -
believe O -
, O -
however O -
, O -
that O -
one O -
individual O -
who O -
called O -
upon O -
him O -
at O -
my O -
chambers O -
, O -
and O -
who O -
, O -
with O -
a O -
grand O -
air O -

he O -

and O -
the O -

But O -
with O -
all O -
his O -
failings O -

and O -
the O -
annoyances O -

caused O -

, O -

; O -
wrote O -
a O -
neat O -

and O -
, O -
when O -

in O -
a O -
gentlemanly O -
sort O -

Added O -
to O -
this O -
, O -
he O -
always O -
dressed O -
in O -
a O -
gentlemanly O -
sort O -
of O -
way O -
; O -
and O -
so O -
, O -
incidentally O -
, O -
reflected O -
credit O -
upon O -
my O -
chambers O -
. O -

Whereas O -
with O -
respect O -
to O -
Turkey B-PER (28)
, O -
I O -
had O -
much O -
ado O -
to O -
keep O -
him O -
from O -
being O -
a O -
reproach O -
to O -
me O -
. O -

His O -
clothes O -
were O -
apt O -
to O -
look O -
oily O -
and O -
smell O -
of O -
eating-houses O -
. O -

He O -
wore O -
his O -
pantaloons O -
very O -
loose O -
and O -
baggy O -
in O -
summer O -
. O -

His O -
coats O -
were O -
execrable O -
; O -
his O -
hat O -
not O -
to O -
be O -
handled O -
. O -

But O -
while O -
the O -
hat O -
was O -
a O -
thing O -
of O -
indifference O -
to O -
me O -
, O -
inasmuch O -
as O -
his O -
natural O -
civility O -
and O -
deference O -
, O -
as O -
a B-PER (49
dependent I-PER -
Englishman I-PER 49)
, O -
always O -
led O -
him O -
to O -
doff O -
it O -
the O -
moment O -
he O -
entered O -
the O -
room O -
, O -
yet O -
his O -
coat O -
was O -
another O -
matter O -
. O -

Concerning O -
his O -
coats O -
, O -
I O -
reasoned O -
with O -
him O -
; O -
but O -
with O -
no O -
effect O -
. O -

The O -
truth O -
was O -
, O -
I O -
suppose O -
, O -
that O -
a B-PER (51
man I-PER -
of I-PER -
so I-PER -
small I-PER -
an I-PER -
income I-PER 51)
, O -
could O -
not O -
afford O -
to O -
sport O -
such O -
a O -
lustrous O -
face O -
and O -
a O -
lustrous O -
coat O -
at O -
one O -
and O -
the O -
same O -
time O -
. O -

As O -
Nippers B-PER (29)
once O -
observed O -
, O -
Turkey B-PER (28)
's O -
money O -
went O -
chiefly O -
for O -
red O -
ink O -
. O -

One O -
winter O -
day O -
I O -
presented O -
Turkey B-PER (28)
with O -
a O -
highly-respectable O -
looking O -
coat O -
of O -
my O -
own O -
, O -
a O -
padded O -
gray O -
coat O -
, O -
of O -
a O -
most O -
comfortable O -
warmth O -
, O -
and O -
which O -
buttoned O -
straight O -
up O -
from O -
the O -
knee O -
to O -
the O -
neck O -
. O -

I O -
thought O -
Turkey B-PER (28)
would O -
appreciate O -
the O -
favor O -
, O -
and O -
abate O -
his O -
rashness O -
and O -
obstreperousness O -
of O -
afternoons O -
. O -

But O -
no O -
. O -

I O -
verily O -
believe O -
that O -
buttoning O -
himself O -
up O -
in O -
so O -
downy O -
and O -
blanket-like O -
a O -
coat O -
had O -
a O -
pernicious O -
effect O -
upon O -
him O -
; O -
upon O -
the O -
same O -
principle O -
that O -
too O -
much O -
oats O -
are O -
bad O -
for O -
horses O -
. O -

In O -
fact O -
, O -
precisely O -
as O -
a O -
rash O -
, O -
restive O -
horse O -
is O -
said O -
to O -
feel O -
his O -
oats O -
, O -
so O -
Turkey B-PER (28)
felt O -
his O -
coat O -
. O -

It O -
made O -

In O -
the O -
bosom O -
of O -
one O -
of O -
those O -
spacious O -
coves O -
which O -
indent O -
the O -
eastern O -

of O -
the O -
Hudson O -

at O -
that O -
broad O -
expansion O -
of O -
the O -

denominated O -
by O -
the B-PER (5

the O -
Tappan O -
Zee O -
, O -
and O -
where O -
they O -
always O -
prudently O -
shortened O -
sail O -
and O -
implored O -
the O -
protection O -
of O -
St. B-PER (6

when O -
they O -
crossed O -
, O -
there O -
lies O -
a O -
small O -
market O -
town O -
or O -
rural O -
port O -
, O -
which O -
by O -
some O -
is O -
called O -
Greensburgh O -
, O -
but O -
which O -
is O -
more O -
generally O -
and O -
properly O -
known O -
by O -
the O -
name O -
of O -
Tarry O -
Town O -
. O -

This O -
name O -
was O -
given O -
, O -
we O -
are O -
told O -
, O -
in O -
former O -
days O -
, O -
by O -
the O -
good O -
housewives O -
of O -
the O -
adjacent O -
country O -

from O -
the O -
inveterate O -

of O -
their B-PER (14|(12)

to O -
linger O -
about O -
the O -

Be O -
that O -
as O -
it O -
may O -
, O -
I O -
do O -
not O -
vouch O -
for O -
the O -
fact O -
, O -
but O -
merely O -
advert O -
to O -
it O -
, O -
for O -
the O -
sake O -
of O -
being O -
precise O -
and O -
authentic O -

Not O -
far O -
from O -
this O -
village O -
, O -
perhaps O -
about O -
two O -
miles O -
, O -
there O -
is O -
a O -
little O -
valley O -
or O -
rather O -
lap O -
of O -
land O -
among O -
high O -
hills O -
, O -
which O -
is O -
one O -
of O -
the O -
quietest O -
places O -
in O -
the O -
whole O -

A O -
small O -
brook O -
glides O -
through O -
it O -
, O -
with O -
just O -
murmur O -
enough O -
to O -
lull O -
one O -
to O -
repose O -
; O -
and O -
the O -
occasional O -
whistle O -
of O -
a O -
quail O -
or O -
tapping O -
of O -
a O -
woodpecker O -
is O -
almost O -
the O -
only O -
sound O -
that O -
ever O -
breaks O -
in O -
upon O -
the O -
uniform O -
tranquillity O -
. O -

I O -
recollect O -
that O -
, O -
when O -
a B-PER (21
stripling I-PER 21)
, O -
my O -
first O -
exploit O -
in O -
squirrel-shooting O -
was O -
in O -
a O -
grove O -
of O -
tall O -
walnut-trees O -
that O -
shades O -
one O -
side O -
of O -
the O -
valley O -
. O -

I O -
had O -
wandered O -
into O -
it O -
at O -
noontime O -
, O -
when O -
all O -
nature O -
is O -
peculiarly O -
quiet O -
, O -
and O -
was O -
startled O -
by O -
the O -
roar O -
of O -
my O -
own O -
gun O -
, O -
as O -
it O -
broke O -
the O -
Sabbath O -
stillness O -
around O -
and O -
was O -
prolonged O -
and O -
reverberated O -
by O -
the O -
angry O -
echoes O -
. O -

If O -
ever O -
I O -
should O -
wish O -
for O -
a O -
retreat O -
whither O -
I O -
might O -
steal O -
from O -
the O -
world O -
and O -
its O -
distractions O -
, O -
and O -
dream O -
quietly O -
away O -
the O -
remnant O -
of O -

none O -
more O -

He O -
was O -

lank O -

with O -
narrow O -
shoulders O -
, O -
long O -
arms O -

dangled O -

with O -
huge O -

, O -
large O -
green O -

and O -
a O -
long O -
snipe O -

so O -
that O -
it O -
looked O -
like O -
a O -
weather-cock O -
perched O -
upon O -
his O -
spindle O -
neck O -
to O -
tell O -
which O -
way O -
the O -

His O -

that O -
was O -
all O -
we O -
could O -
learn O -
of O -
our B-PER (1|(9)

He O -
was O -
a B-PER (75
very I-PER -
silent I-PER -

by O -
custom O -

All O -
day O -
he O -
hung O -
round O -

upon O -
the O -

with O -
a O -
brass O -

all O -

he O -
sat O -
in O -

drank O -

very O -

Mostly O -
he O -
would O -
not O -
speak O -

spoken O -

only O -
look O -
up O -
sudden O -

we O -

the O -

came O -

Every O -
day O -
when O -
he O -
came O -
back O -
from O -
his O -

he O -
would O -
ask O -
if O -
any O -
seafaring B-PER (28

had O -
gone O -
by O -
along O -
the O -
road O -

At O -
first O -
we O -
thought O -
it O -
was O -
the O -
want O -

made O -
him O -
ask O -
this O -

at O -

we O -
began O -
to O -
see O -
he O -
was O -
desirous O -
to O -
avoid O -
them O -

When O -
a B-PER (30

he O -
would O -
look O -

him O -
through O -
the O -
curtained O -

he O -
was O -

any O -

would O -
only O -
blow O -
through O -
his O -
nose O -
at O -
me O -
and O -
stare O -
me O -
down O -
, O -
but O -
before O -
the O -
week O -
was O -
out O -
he O -
was O -
sure O -
to O -
think O -
better O -
of O -
it O -
, O -
bring O -
me O -
my O -
four-penny O -
piece O -
, O -
and O -
repeat O -
his O -
orders O -
to O -
look O -
out O -
for O -
" O -
the B-PER (32
seafaring I-PER -
man I-PER -
with O -
one O -
leg O -
. O -
" O -

How O -
that B-PER (32
personage I-PER 32)
haunted O -
my O -
dreams O -
, O -
I O -
need O -
scarcely O -
tell O -
you O -
. O -

On O -
stormy O -
nights O -
, O -
when O -
the O -
wind O -
shook O -
the O -
four O -
corners O -
of O -
the O -
house O -
and O -
the O -
surf O -
roared O -
along O -
the O -
cove O -
and O -
up O -
the O -
cliffs O -
, O -
I O -
would O -
see O -
him O -
in O -
a O -
thousand O -
forms O -
, O -
and O -
with O -
a O -
thousand O -
diabolical O -
expressions O -
. O -

Now O -
the O -
leg O -
would O -
be O -
cut O -
off O -
at O -
the O -
knee O -
, O -
now O -
at O -
the O -
hip O -
; O -
now O -
he O -
was O -
a B-PER (80
monstrous I-PER -
kind I-PER -
of I-PER -
a I-PER -
creature I-PER -
who I-PER -
had I-PER -
never I-PER -
had I-PER -
but I-PER -
the I-PER -
one I-PER -
leg I-PER -
, I-PER -
and I-PER -
that I-PER -
in I-PER -
the I-PER -
middle I-PER -
of I-PER -
his I-PER (32)
body I-PER 80)
. O -

To O -
see O -
him O -
leap O -
and O -
run O -
and O -
pursue O -
me O -
over O -
hedge O -
and O -
ditch O -
was O -
the O -
worst O -
of O -
nightmares O -
. O -

And O -
altogether O -
I O -
paid O -
pretty O -
dear O -
for O -
my O -
monthly O -
fourpenny O -
piece O -
, O -
in O -
the O -
shape O -
of O -
these O -
abominable O -
fancies O -
. O -

But O -
though O -
I O -
was O -
so O -
terrified O -
by O -
the O -
idea O -
of O -
the B-PER (32
seafaring I-PER -
man I-PER 32)
with O -
one O -
leg O -
, O -
I O -
was O -
far O -
less O -
afraid O -
of O -
the B-PER (1
captain I-PER -
himself I-PER 1)|(1)
than O -
anybody B-PER (34
else I-PER -
who I-PER -
knew I-PER -
him I-PER 34)|(1)
. O -

There O -
were O -
nights O -
when O -
he O -
took O -
a O -
deal O -
more O -
rum O -
and O -
water O -
than O -
his O -
head O -
would O -
carry O -
; O -
and O -
then O -
he O -
would O -
sometimes O -
sit O -
and O -
sing O -
his O -
wicked O -
, O -
old O -
, O -
wild O -
sea-songs O -
, O -
minding O -
nobody B-PER (35)
; O -
but O -
sometimes O -
he O -
would O -
call O -
for O -
glasses O -
round O -
and O -
force O -
all O -
the B-PER (36
trembling I-PER -
company I-PER 36)
to O -
listen O -
to O -
his O -
stories O -
or O -
bear O -
a O -
chorus O -
to O -
his O -
singing O -
. O -

Often O -
I O -
have O -
heard O -
the O -
house O -
shaking O -
with O -
" O -
Yo-ho-ho O -
, O -
and O -
a O -
bottle O -
of O -
rum O -
, O -
" O -
all O -
the B-PER (37
neighbours I-PER 37)
joining O -
in O -
for O -
dear O -
life O -
, O -
with O -
the O -
fear O -
of O -
death O -
upon O -
them O -
, O -
and O -
each O -
singing O -
louder O -
than O -
the O -
other O -
to O -
avoid O -
remark O -
. O -

For O -
in O -
these O -
fits O -
he O -
was O -
the B-PER (76
most I-PER -
overriding I-PER -
companion I-PER 76)
ever O -
known O -
; O -
he O -
would O -
slap O -
his O -
hand O -
on O -
the O -
table O -
for O -
silence O -
all O -
round O -
; O -
he O -
would O -
fly O -
up O -
in O -
a O -
passion O -
of O -
anger O -
at O -
a O -
question O -
, O -
or O -
sometimes O -
because O -
none O -
was O -
put O -
, O -
and O -
so O -
he O -
judged O -
the B-PER (38
company I-PER 38)
was O -
not O -
following O -
his O -
story O -
. O -

Nor O -
would O -
he O -
allow O -
anyone B-PER (39)
to O -
leave O -
the O -
inn O -
till O -
he O -
had O -
drunk O -
himself O -
sleepy O -
and O -
reeled O -
off O -
to O -
bed O -
. O -

His O -
stories O -
were O -
what O -
frightened O -
people B-PER (40)
worst O -
of O -
all O -
. O -

Dreadful O -
stories O -
they O -
were O -
-- O -
about O -
hanging O -

and O -
walking O -

, O -
and O -
storms O -

Tortugas O -

wild O -
deeds O -
and O -
places O -
on O -
the O -
Spanish O -
Main O -
. O -

By O -
his O -
own O -
account O -
he O -
must O -
have O -
lived O -
his O -
life O -
among O -
some B-PER (69
of I-PER -
the I-PER -
wickedest I-PER -
men I-PER -
that O -
God B-PER (45)
ever O -
allowed O -
upon O -
the O -
sea O -
, O -
and O -
the O -
language O -
in O -
which O -
he O -
told O -
these O -
stories O -
shocked O -
our B-PER (46|(9)
plain I-PER -
country I-PER -
people I-PER 46)
almost O -
as O -
much O -
as O -
the O -
crimes O -
that O -
he O -
described O -
. O -

My B-PER (8|(6)
father I-PER 8)
was O -
always O -
saying O -
the O -
inn O -
would O -
be O -
ruined O -
, O -
for O -
people B-PER (47)
would O -
soon O -
cease O -
coming O -
there O -
to O -
be O -
tyrannized O -
over O -
and O -
put O -
down O -
, O -
and O -
sent O -
shivering O -
to O -
their O -
beds O -
; O -
but O -
I O -
really O -
believe O -
his O -
presence O -
did O -
us O -
good O -
. O -

People B-PER (48)
were O -
frightened O -
at O -
the O -
time O -
, O -
but O -
on O -
looking O -
back O -
they O -
rather O -
liked O -
it O -
; O -
it O -
was O -
a O -
fine O -
excitement O -
in O -
a O -
quiet O -
country O -
life O -
, O -
and O -
there O -
was O -
even O -
a B-PER (49
party I-PER -
of I-PER -
the I-PER -
younger I-PER -
men I-PER 49)
who O -
pretended O -
to O -
admire O -
him O -
, O -
calling O -
him O -
a B-PER (77
" I-PER -
true I-PER -
sea-dog I-PER -
" I-PER 77)
and O -
a B-PER (78
" I-PER -
real I-PER -

" I-PER 78)
and O -
such O -
like O -
names O -
, O -
and O -
saying O -
there O -
was O -
the O -
sort O -
of O -
man O -
that O -
made O -
England O -
terrible O -
at O -
sea O -
. O -

In O -
one O -
way O -
, O -
indeed O -
, O -
he O -
bade O -
fair O -
to O -
ruin O -
us O -
, O -
for O -
he O -
kept O -
on O -
staying O -
week O -
after O -
week O -
, O -
and O -
at O -
last O -
month O -
after O -
month O -
, O -
so O -
that O -
all O -
the O -
money O -
had O -
been O -
long O -
exhausted O -
, O -
and O -
still O -
my B-PER (8|(6)
father I-PER 8)
never O -
plucked O -
up O -
the O -
heart O -
to O -
insist O -
on O -
having O -
more O -
. O -

If O -
ever O -
he O -
mentioned O -
it O -
, O -
the B-PER (1
captain I-PER 1)
blew O -
through O -
his O -
nose O -
so O -
loudly O -
that O -
you O -
might O -
say O -
he O -
roared O -
, O -
and O -
stared O -
my B-PER (8|(6)
poor I-PER -
father I-PER 8)
out O -
of O -
the O -
room O -
. O -

I O -
have O -
seen O -
him O -
wringing O -
his O -
hands O -
after O -
such O -
a O -
rebuff O -
, O -
and O -
I O -
am O -
sure O -
the O -
annoyance O -
and O -
the O -
terror O -
he O -
lived O -
in O -
must O -
have O -
greatly O -
hastened O -
his O -
early O -
and O -
unhappy O -
death O -
. O -

All O -
the O -
time O -
he O -
lived O -
with O -
us O -
the B-PER (1
captain I-PER 1)
made O -
no O -
change O -
whatever O -
in O -
his O -
dress O -
but O -
to O -
buy O -
some O -
stockings O -
from O -
a B-PER (53
hawker I-PER 53)
. O -

One O -
of O -
the O -
cocks O -
of O -
his O -
hat O -
having O -
fallen O -
down O -
, O -
he O -
let O -
it O -
hang O -
from O -
that O -
day O -
forth O -
, O -
though O -
it O -
was O -
a O -
great O -
annoyance O -
when O -
it O -
blew O -
. O -

I O -
remember O -
the O -
appearance O -
of O -
his O -
coat O -
, O -
which O -
he O -
patched O -
himself O -
upstairs O -
in O -
his O -
room O -
, O -
and O -
which O -
, O -
before O -
the O -
end O -
, O -
was O -
nothing O -
but O -
patches O -
. O -

He O -
never O -
wrote O -
or O -
received O -
a O -
letter O -
, O -
and O -
he O -
never O -
spoke O -
with O -
any O -
but O -
the B-PER (56
neighbours I-PER 56)
, O -
and O -
with O -
these O -
, O -
for O -
the O -
most O -
part O -
, O -
only O -
when O -
drunk O -
on O -
rum O -
. O -

The O -
great O -
sea-chest O -
none O -
of O -
us O -
had O -
ever O -
seen O -
open O -
. O -

He O -
was O -
only O -
once O -
crossed O -
, O -
and O -
that O -
was O -
towards O -
the O -
end O -
, O -
when O -
my B-PER (8|(6)
poor I-PER -
father I-PER 8)
was O -
far O -
gone O -
in O -
a O -
decline O -
that O -
took O -
him O -
off O -
. O -

Dr. B-PER (4
Livesey O -
came O -
late O -
one O -
afternoon O -
to O -
see O -
the B-PER (8
patient I-PER 8)
, O -
took O -
a O -
bit O -
of O -
dinner O -
from O -
my B-PER (57|(6)
mother I-PER 57)
, O -
and O -
went O -
into O -
the O -
parlour O -
to O -
smoke O -
a O -
pipe O -
until O -
his O -
horse O -
should O -
come O -
down O -
from O -
the O -
hamlet O -
, O -
for O -
we O -
had O -
no O -
stabling O -
at O -
the O -
old O -
Benbow O -
. O -

I O -
followed O -
him O -
in O -
, O -
and O -
I O -
remember O -
observing O -
the O -
contrast O -
the B-PER (4
neat I-PER -
, I-PER -
bright I-PER -
doctor I-PER 4)
, O -
with O -
his O -

as O -
white O -
as O -
snow O -
and O -
his O -
bright O -
, O -
black O -
eyes O -
and O -
pleasant O -
manners O -
, O -
made O -
with O -
the B-PER (59
coltish I-PER -
country I-PER -
folk I-PER 59)
, O -
and O -
above O -
all O -
, O -
with O -
that B-PER (1
filthy I-PER -

heavy I-PER -
, I-PER -
bleared I-PER -
scarecrow I-PER -
of I-PER -

of O -

sitting O -

far O -
gone O -
in O -

, O -
with O -
his O -

on O -
the O -

Suddenly O -
he O -
-- O -
the B-PER (1
captain I-PER 1)
, O -
that O -
is O -
-- O -
began O -
to O -
pipe O -
up O -
his O -
eternal O -
song O -
: O -

At O -

I O -
had O -
supposed O -

with O -

of O -
the B-PER (32

But O -
by O -
this O -
time O -
we O -
had O -
all O -
long O -
ceased O -
to O -
pay O -
any O -
particular O -
notice O -

to O -
nobody O -

Dr. B-PER (4

him O -
I O -
observed O -

not O -

for O -

looked O -
up O -

In O -
the O -

, O -
the B-PER (1

gradually O -
brightened O -
up O -
at O -
his O -

he O -
had O -
any O -
money O -
left O -
afterwards O -
, O -
he O -
would O -
invite O -
some B-PER (46
of I-PER -
his I-PER (0)
friends I-PER 46)
in O -
somewhere O -
to O -
have O -
an O -
oyster-stew O -
; O -
so O -
it O -
seldom O -
happened O -
that O -
he O -
commenced O -
the O -
day O -
with O -
a O -
penny O -
. O -

Then O -
I O -
am O -
sorry O -
to O -
add O -
that O -
Dick B-PER (0)
had O -
formed O -
the O -
habit O -
of O -
smoking O -
. O -

This O -
cost O -
him O -
considerable O -
, O -
for O -
Dick B-PER (0)
was O -
rather O -
fastidious O -
about O -
his O -
cigars O -
, O -
and O -
would O -
n't O -
smoke O -
the O -
cheapest O -
. O -

Besides O -
, O -
having O -
a O -
liberal O -
nature O -
, O -
he O -
was O -
generally O -
ready O -
to O -
treat O -
his B-PER (47|(0)
companions I-PER 47)
. O -

But O -
of O -
course O -
the O -
expense O -
was O -
the O -
smallest O -
objection O -
. O -

No B-PER (48
boy I-PER -
of I-PER -
fourteen I-PER 48)
can O -
smoke O -
without O -
being O -
affected O -
injuriously O -
. O -

Men B-PER (49)
are O -
frequently O -
injured O -
by O -
smoking O -
, O -
and O -
boys B-PER (50)
always O -
. O -

But O -
large B-PER (51
numbers I-PER -
of I-PER -
the I-PER -
newsboys I-PER -
and I-PER -
boot-blacks I-PER 51)
form O -
the O -
habit O -
. O -

Exposed O -
to O -
the O -
cold O -
and O -
wet O -
they O -
find O -
that O -
it O -
warms O -
them O -
up O -
, O -
and O -
the O -
self-indulgence O -
grows O -
upon O -
them O -
. O -

It O -
is O -
not O -
uncommon O -
to O -
see O -
a B-PER (52
little I-PER -
boy I-PER 52)
, O -
too O -
young O -
to O -
be O -
out O -
of O -
his B-PER (53|(52)

's O -
sight O -
, O -
smoking O -
with O -
all O -
the O -
apparent O -
satisfaction O -
of O -
a B-PER (54
veteran I-PER -
smoker I-PER 54)
. O -

There O -
was O -
another O -
way O -
in O -
which O -
Dick B-PER (0)
sometimes O -
lost O -
money O -
. O -

There O -
was O -
a O -
noted O -
gambling-house O -
on O -
Baxter O -
Street O -
, O -
which O -
in O -
the O -
evening O -
was O -
sometimes O -
crowded O -
with O -
these B-PER (57
juvenile I-PER -
gamesters I-PER 57)
, O -
who O -
staked O -
their O -
hard O -
earnings O -
, O -
generally O -
losing O -
of O -
course O -
, O -
and O -
refreshing O -
themselves O -
from O -
time O -
to O -
time O -
with O -
a O -
vile O -
mixture O -
of O -
liquor O -
at O -
two O -
cents O -
a O -
glass O -
. O -

Sometimes O -
Dick B-PER (0)
strayed O -
in O -
here O -
, O -
and O -
played O -
with O -
the B-PER (57
rest I-PER 57)
. O -

I O -
have O -
mentioned O -
Dick B-PER (0)
's O -
faults O -
and O -
defects O -
, O -
because O -
I O -
want O -
it O -
understood O -
, O -
to O -
begin O -
with O -
, O -
that O -
I O -
do O -
n't O -
consider O -
him O -
a B-PER (61
model I-PER -
boy I-PER 61)
. O -

But O -
there O -
were O -
some O -
good O -
points O -
about O -
him O -
nevertheless O -
. O -

He O -
was O -
above O -
doing O -
anything O -
mean O -
or O -
dishonorable O -
. O -

He O -
would O -
not O -
steal O -
, O -
or O -
cheat O -
, O -
or O -
impose O -
upon O -
younger B-PER (58
boys I-PER 58)
, O -
but O -
was O -
frank O -
and O -
straight-forward O -
, O -
manly O -
and O -
self-reliant O -
. O -

His O -
nature O -
was O -
a O -
noble O -
one O -
, O -
and O -
had O -
saved O -
him O -
from O -
all O -
mean O -
faults O -
. O -

I O -
hope O -
my B-PER (59|(31)
young I-PER -
readers I-PER 59)
will O -
like O -
him O -
as O -
I O -
do O -
, O -
without O -
being O -
blind O -
to O -
his O -
faults O -
. O -

Perhaps O -
, O -
although O -
he O -
was O -
only O -
a B-PER (65
boot-black I-PER 65)
, O -
they O -
may O -
find O -
something O -
in O -
him O -
to O -
imitate O -
. O -

me O -
several O -

, O -
he O -
came O -
closer O -

my O -

took O -
me O -
by O -
both O -

and O -
tilted O -

back O -
as O -

as O -
he O -

so O -

After O -

tilted O -

over O -

little O -
more O -

so O -
as O -

a O -
greater O -

said O -
the B-PER (19

I O -
said O -
so O -
, O -

he O -
took O -
me O -
down O -
. O -

“ O -
Now O -
, O -
” O -
he O -
pursued O -
, O -
“ O -
you O -

“ O -
Goo-good O -

” O -
I O -
faltered O -
. O -

“ O -
Much O -
of O -
that O -
! O -
” O -

said O -
he O -
, O -
glancing O -
about O -
him O -
over O -
the O -
cold O -

“ O -
I O -
wish O -
I O -

a O -
frog O -

Or O -
a O -
eel O -
! O -

At O -
the O -
same O -
time O -
, O -
he O -
hugged O -
his O -
shuddering O -
body O -
in O -
both O -
his O -
arms O -
, O -
-- O -
clasping O -
himself O -
, O -
as O -

himself O -
together O -
, O -
-- O -
and O -
limped O -
towards O -
the O -
low O -
church O -
wall O -
. O -

As O -
I O -
saw O -
him O -
go O -
, O -
picking O -
his O -
way O -
among O -
the O -
nettles O -
, O -
and O -
among O -
the O -
brambles O -
that O -
bound O -
the O -
green O -
mounds O -
, O -
he O -
looked O -
in O -
my O -
young O -
eyes O -
as O -
if O -
he O -
were O -
eluding O -
the O -
hands O -
of O -
the O -
dead O -
people O -
, O -
stretching O -
up O -
cautiously O -
out O -
of O -
their O -
graves O -
, O -
to O -
get O -
a O -
twist O -
upon O -
his O -
ankle O -
and O -
pull O -
him O -
in O -
. O -

When O -
he O -
came O -
to O -
the O -
low O -
church O -
wall O -
, O -
he O -
got O -
over O -
it O -
, O -
like O -
a B-PER (37
man I-PER -
whose I-PER -
legs I-PER -
were I-PER -
numbed I-PER -

stiff I-PER 37)

then O -
turned O -
round O -

look O -
for O -

When O -
I O -
saw O -
him O -
turning O -

I O -
set O -
my O -
face O -
towards O -

made O -
the O -

my O -
legs O -

But O -
presently O -
I O -
looked O -
over O -
my O -
shoulder O -

saw O -
him O -
going O -
on O -
again O -
towards O -
the O -
river O -

still O -
hugging O -
himself O -
in O -
both O -

and O -
picking O -
his O -
way O -
with O -
his O -
sore O -
feet O -
among O -
the O -
great O -
stones O -
dropped O -
into O -
the O -
marshes O -
here O -

there O -

for O -

were O -
heavy O -

awhile O -

Death O -
is O -
not O -
more O -
still O -
than O -
is O -
this O -
Virginian O -
land O -
in O -
the O -
hour O -
when O -
the O -
sun O -
has O -
sunk O -
away O -

it O -
is O -
black O -
beneath O -
the O -
trees O -
, O -
and O -
the O -
stars O -
brighten O -
slowly O -
and O -
softly O -
, O -
one O -
by O -
one O -
. O -

The O -
birds O -
that O -
sing O -
all O -

hushed O -

the O -
horned O -
owls O -

the O -

and O -
that O -
strange O -

ominous O -

Later O -
the O -

but O -
now O -
there O -
is O -
no O -

The O -
winds O -
are O -
laid O -

the O -

are O -
quiet O -

The O -
low O -
lap O -
of O -
the O -
water O -
among O -
the O -

is O -
like O -

A O -

upon O -

, O -
good B-PER (6
Mr. I-PER -

exhorted O -
us O -
to O -
be O -
on O -
our O -

and O -
in O -
his O -
prayer O -
besought O -
that O -
no O -

the O -
churchyard O -
, O -
between O -
the O -

, O -
the B-PER (13

began O -
to O -
tell O -

had O -
observed O -

to O -

The B-PER (14

laughed O -
them O -
to O -

, O -
but O -
the B-PER (15

began O -
to O -
weep O -
and O -
cower O -
, O -
and O -
I O -
, O -
though O -
I O -
laughed O -
too O -

in O -

telling O -
us O -
that O -
the B-PER (9

watched O -

, O -
that O -

which O -
that B-PER (16

had O -
struck O -
into O -
their O -

that O -

At O -
first O -
the O -
tiny O -
house O -
of O -
Mrs. B-PER (22
Almira O -
Todd O -
, O -
which O -
stood O -
with O -
its O -
end O -
to O -
the O -
street O -
, O -
appeared O -
to O -
be O -
retired O -

sheltered O -
enough O -
from O -

the O -
discovery O -
was O -
soon O -
made O -
that O -
Mrs. B-PER (22

was O -
an O -
ardent O -
lover O -
of O -
herbs O -
, O -
both O -
wild O -

and O -
the O -

into O -
the O -

wormwood O -

If O -
Mrs. B-PER (22

had O -
occasion O -
to O -
step O -
into O -
the O -
far O -
corner O -
of O -
her O -
herb O -
plot O -
, O -
she O -
trod O -
heavily O -
upon O -
thyme O -
, O -
and O -
made O -
its O -
fragrant O -
presence O -
known O -
with O -
all O -
the O -
rest O -
. O -

Being O -
a B-PER (67
very I-PER -
large I-PER -
person I-PER 67)
, O -
her O -
full O -
skirts O -
brushed O -
and O -
bent O -
almost O -
every O -
slender O -
stalk O -
that O -
her O -
feet O -
missed O -

You O -
could O -
always O -
tell O -
when O -
she O -
was O -
stepping O -
about O -
there O -
, O -
even O -
when O -
you O -
were O -
half O -
awake O -
in O -
the O -
morning O -
, O -
and O -
learned O -
to O -
know O -
, O -
in O -
the O -
course O -
of O -
a O -
few O -
weeks O -
’ O -
experience O -
, O -
in O -
exactly O -
which O -
corner O -
of O -
the O -
garden O -
she O -
might O -
be O -
. O -

At O -
one O -
side O -
of O -
this O -
herb O -

were O -
other O -
growths O -
of O -

rustic O -

, O -
great O -
treasures O -
and O -
rarities O -
among O -

There O -
were O -
some O -
strange O -
and O -
pungent O -
odors O -
that O -
roused O -
a O -
dim O -
sense O -
and O -
remembrance O -
of O -
something O -
in O -
the O -
forgotten O -
past O -
. O -

Some O -
of O -
these O -

way O -

while O -
she O -

long O -
chapters O -
of O -

kept O -
up O -
an O -
air O -
of O -
secrecy O -

upon O -
the O -

The B-PER (36

may O -
have O -
counted O -
upon O -
the O -
unfavorable O -
effect O -
of O -
certain O -

he O -
should O -
find O -
his O -
opportunity O -
in O -

at O -
any O -

now O -

stopped O -

with O -
Mrs. B-PER (22

The O -
conversation O -
became O -
at O -
once O -
professional O -
after O -
the O -
briefest O -
preliminaries O -

would O -
stand O -

in O -
which O -
my B-PER (22|(16)

such O -

sometimes O -
to O -

To O -

of O -

when O -
the O -

to O -

the O -

This O -

wonderful O -

My B-PER (22|(16)

our O -

were O -
many O -

the O -

every O -

the O -

only O -

more O -

looked O -

found O -

( O -
so O -

She O -

the O -

she O -
felt O -
her O -
approach O -

He O -
was O -
about O -

His O -
black O -
cloth O -

made O -
him O -
look O -
like O -
a B-PER (87

. O -

His O -
shrunken O -
brown O -
flannel O -

and O -
the B-PER (38

hurried I-PER -

, O -
afraid O -
to O -
go O -
into O -
the O -
store O -

ask O -

so O -
he O -
sat O -
wringing O -

up O -

to O -
him O -
a O -
very O -
strange O -

where O -
people B-PER (43)
wore O -
fine O -

had O -
hard O -
hearts O -

wanted O -

him O -

Just O -
now O -
, O -
he O -
was O -
too O -
unhappy O -

At O -

seemed O -
to O -

ray O -

he O -
exclaimed O -

quite O -
innocently O -

foolishly O -

She O -
stabbed O -
him O -
with O -
a O -
glance O -
of O -
Amazonian O -
fierceness O -
and O -
drew O -
in O -
her O -
lower O -

most O -
unnecessary O -
severity O -
. O -

It O -
gave O -
the B-PER (50

such O -
a O -
start O -
that O -
he O -
actually O -
let O -
his O -

fall O -

went O -
off O -

in O -

His O -

was O -
still O -
unsteady O -
when O -
he O -
took O -
his O -
glass O -
from O -
the B-PER (52

His O -
feeble O -
flirtatious O -
instincts O -
had O -
been O -
crushed O -
before O -

but O -
never O -
so O -
mercilessly O -

He O -
felt O -
cheap O -
and O -
ill-used O -
, O -
as O -
if O -
some O -

had O -
taken O -
advantage O -
of O -
him O -

When O -
a B-PER (53

been O -
knocking O -
about O -

While O -

his O -

darted O -
up O -

Alexandra B-PER (41)
watched O -
him O -
anxiously O -
; O -
the O -

The O -

Carl B-PER (49)
had O -
to O -
go O -
to O -
the O -

of O -
the O -

and O -
then O -
had O -
some O -

in O -
tearing O -

When O -

“ O -

The B-PER (41

She O -
looked O -
fixedly O -
up O -

about O -

Carl B-PER (49)
did O -
not O -

anything O -

she O -
felt O -
his O -
sympathy O -

his O -

The O -
lips O -
had O -
already O -
a O -
little O -

of O -

The B-PER (70

for O -
a O -

moments O -
on O -
the O -
windy O -

not O -

Mr. B-PER (5

strange O -
tale O -

When O -
my B-PER (2|(1)
convivial I-PER -
host I-PER 2)
discovered O -
that O -
he O -
had O -
told O -
me O -
so O -
much O -
, O -
and O -
that O -
I O -
was O -
prone O -
to O -
doubtfulness O -
, O -
his O -
foolish O -
pride O -
assumed O -
the O -
task O -
the O -
old O -
vintage O -
had O -
commenced O -
, O -
and O -
so O -
he O -
unearthed O -
written O -
evidence O -
in O -
the O -
form O -
of O -
musty O -

, O -
and O -
dry O -
official O -

to O -

many O -
of O -
the O -
salient O -

of O -
his O -
remarkable O -
narrative O -
. O -

I O -
do O -
not O -
say O -
the O -
story O -
is O -
true O -
, O -
for O -
I O -
did O -
not O -
witness O -
the O -
happenings O -
which O -
it O -
portrays O -
, O -
but O -
the O -
fact O -
that O -
in O -
the O -
telling O -
of O -
it O -
to O -
you O -
I O -
have O -
taken O -
fictitious O -
names O -
for O -
the B-PER (6

quite O -
sufficiently O -
evidences O -
the O -
sincerity O -

MAY O -
be O -

so O -
I O -
give O -
you O -

I O -

From O -

from O -
the B-PER (7

's O -
diary O -
we O -
learn O -
that O -
a B-PER (12
certain I-PER -
young I-PER -
English I-PER -
nobleman I-PER 12)
, O -
whom O -
we O -
shall O -
call O -
John B-PER (12
Clayton I-PER 12)
, O -
Lord B-PER (82
Greystoke O -
, O -
was O -
commissioned O -
to O -
make O -
a O -
peculiarly O -
delicate O -
investigation O -
of O -
conditions O -
in O -
a O -
British O -
West O -
Coast O -
African O -
Colony O -
from O -
whose O -
simple B-PER (15
native I-PER -
inhabitants I-PER 15)
another O -
European O -
power O -
was O -
known O -
to O -
be O -
recruiting O -
soldiers B-PER (17)
for O -
its O -
native O -
army O -
, O -
which O -
it O -
used O -
solely O -
for O -
the O -
forcible O -
collection O -
of O -
rubber O -
and O -
ivory O -
from O -
the O -
savage O -
tribes O -
along O -
the O -
Congo O -
and O -
the O -
Aruwimi O -
. O -

The O -
natives O -
of O -
the O -
British O -
Colony O -
complained O -
that O -
many O -
of O -
their B-PER (23|(22)
young I-PER -
men I-PER 23)
were O -
enticed O -
away O -
through O -
the O -
medium O -
of O -
fair O -
and O -
glowing O -
promises O -
, O -
but O -
that O -
few O -
if O -
any O -
ever O -
returned O -
to O -
their B-PER (24|(23)
families I-PER 24)
. O -

The O -
Englishmen O -
in O -
Africa O -
went O -
even O -
further O -
, O -
saying O -
that O -
these B-PER (22
poor I-PER -
blacks I-PER 22)
were O -
held O -
in O -
virtual O -
slavery O -
, O -
since O -
after O -
their O -
terms O -
of O -
enlistment O -
expired O -
their O -
ignorance O -
was O -
imposed O -
upon O -
by O -
their B-PER (27|(22)
white I-PER -
officers I-PER 27)
, O -
and O -
they O -
were O -
told O -
that O -
they O -
had O -
yet O -
several O -
years O -
to O -
serve O -
. O -

And O -
so O -
the O -
Colonial O -
Office O -
appointed O -
John B-PER (12
Clayton I-PER 12)
to O -
a O -
new O -
post O -
in O -
British O -
West O -
Africa O -
, O -
but O -
his O -
confidential O -
instructions O -
centered O -
on O -
a O -
thorough O -
investigation O -
of O -
the O -
unfair O -
treatment O -
of O -
black B-PER (30
British I-PER -
subjects I-PER 30)
by O -
the O -
officers O -
of O -
a O -
friendly O -
European O -
power O -
. O -

Why O -
he O -
was O -
sent O -
, O -
is O -
, O -
however O -
, O -
of O -
little O -
moment O -
to O -
this O -
story O -
, O -
for O -
he O -
never O -
made O -
an O -
investigation O -
, O -
nor O -
, O -
in O -
fact O -
, O -
did O -
he O -
ever O -
reach O -
his O -
destination O -
. O -

Clayton B-PER (12)
was O -
the O -
type O -
of O -
Englishman B-PER (31)
that O -
one O -
likes O -
best O -
to O -
associate O -
with O -
the O -
noblest O -
monuments O -
of O -
historic O -
achievement O -
upon O -
a O -
thousand O -
victorious O -
battlefields O -
-- O -
a B-PER (85
strong I-PER -
, I-PER -
virile I-PER -
man I-PER 85)
-- O -
mentally O -
, O -
morally O -
, O -
and O -
physically O -
. O -

In O -
stature O -
he O -
was O -
above O -
the O -
average O -
height O -
; O -
his O -
eyes O -
were O -
gray O -
, O -
his O -
features O -
regular O -
and O -
strong O -
; O -
his O -
carriage O -
that O -
of O -
perfect O -
, O -
robust O -
health O -
influenced O -
by O -
his O -
years O -
of O -
army O -
training O -
. O -

Political O -
ambition O -
had O -
caused O -
him O -
to O -
seek O -
transference O -
from O -
the O -
army O -
to O -
the O -
Colonial O -
Office O -
and O -
so O -
we O -
find O -
him O -
, O -
still O -
young O -
, O -
entrusted O -
with O -
a O -
delicate O -
and O -
important O -
commission O -
in O -
the O -
service O -
of O -
the B-PER (36
Queen I-PER 36)
. O -

When O -
he O -
received O -
this O -
appointment O -
he O -
was O -
both O -
elated O -
and O -
appalled O -
. O -

The O -
preferment O -
seemed O -
to O -
him O -
in O -
the O -
nature O -
of O -
a O -
well-merited O -
reward O -
for O -
painstaking O -
and O -
intelligent O -
service O -
, O -
and O -
as O -
a O -
stepping O -
stone O -
to O -
posts O -
of O -
greater O -
importance O -
and O -
responsibility O -
; O -
but O -
, O -
on O -
the O -
other O -
hand O -
, O -
he O -
had O -
been O -
married O -
to O -
the B-PER (37
Hon. I-PER -
Alice I-PER -
Rutherford I-PER 37)
for O -
scarce O -
a O -
three O -
months O -
, O -
and O -
it O -
was O -
the O -
thought O -
of O -
taking O -
this B-PER (37
fair I-PER -
young I-PER -
girl I-PER 37)
into O -
the O -
dangers O -
and O -
isolation O -
of O -
tropical O -
Africa O -
that O -
appalled O -
him O -
. O -

For O -
her O -
sake O -
he O -
would O -
have O -
refused O -
the O -
appointment O -
, O -
but O -
she O -
would O -
not O -
have O -
it O -
so O -
. O -

Instead O -
she O -
insisted O -
that O -
he O -
accept O -
, O -
and O -
, O -
indeed O -
, O -
take O -
her O -
with O -
him O -
. O -

There O -
were O -
mothers B-PER (38)
and O -
brothers B-PER (39)
and O -
sisters B-PER (40)
, O -
and O -
aunts B-PER (41)
and O -
cousins B-PER (42)
to O -
express O -
various O -
opinions O -
on O -
the O -
subject O -
, O -
but O -
as O -
to O -
what O -
they O -
severally O -
advised O -
history O -
is O -
silent O -
. O -

We O -
know O -
only O -
that O -
on O -
a O -
bright O -
May O -
morning O -
in O -
1888 O -
, O -
John B-PER (12)
, O -
Lord B-PER (12
Greystoke O -
, O -
and O -
Lady B-PER (37
Alice O -
sailed O -
from O -
Dover O -
on O -
their O -
way O -
to O -
Africa O -
. O -

A O -
month O -
later O -
they O -
arrived O -
at O -
Freetown O -
where O -
they O -
chartered O -
a O -
small O -
sailing O -
vessel O -
, O -
the O -
Fuwalda O -
, O -
which O -
was O -
to O -
bear O -
them O -
to O -
their O -
final O -
destination O -
. O -

And O -
here O -
John B-PER (12)
, O -
Lord B-PER (12
Greystoke O -
, O -
and O -
Lady B-PER (37
Alice O -
, O -
his B-PER (83|(12)
wife I-PER 83)
, O -
vanished O -
from O -
the O -
eyes O -
and O -
from O -
the O -
knowledge O -
of O -
men B-PER (49)
. O -

Two O -
months O -
after O -
they O -
weighed O -
anchor O -
and O -
cleared O -
from O -
the O -
port O -
of O -
Freetown O -
a O -
half O -
dozen O -
British O -
war O -
vessels O -
were O -
scouring O -
the O -
south O -
Atlantic O -
for O -
trace O -
of O -
them O -
or O -
their O -
little O -
vessel O -
, O -
and O -
it O -
was O -
almost O -
immediately O -
that O -
the O -
wreckage O -
was O -
found O -
upon O -
the O -
shores O -
of O -
St. B-PER (55
Helena O -
which O -
convinced O -
the B-PER (56
world I-PER 56)
that O -
the O -
Fuwalda O -
had O -
gone O -
down O -
with O -
all B-PER (57
on I-PER -
board I-PER 57)
, O -
and O -
hence O -
the O -
search O -
was O -
stopped O -
ere O -
it O -
had O -
scarce O -
begun O -
; O -
though O -
hope O -
lingered O -
in O -
longing O -
hearts O -
for O -
many O -
years O -
. O -

The O -
Fuwalda O -
, O -
a O -
barkentine O -
of O -
about O -
one O -
hundred O -
tons O -
, O -
was O -
a O -
vessel O -
of O -
the O -
type O -
often O -
seen O -
in O -
coastwise O -
trade O -
in O -
the O -
far O -
southern O -
Atlantic O -
, O -
their B-PER (58
crews I-PER 58)
composed O -
of O -
the O -
offscourings O -
of O -
the O -
sea O -
-- O -
unhanged O -
murderers O -
and O -
cutthroats O -
of O -
every O -
race O -
and O -
every O -
nation O -
. O -

The O -
Fuwalda O -
was O -
no O -
exception O -
to O -
the O -
rule O -
. O -

Her B-PER (61|(53)
officers I-PER 61)
were O -
swarthy B-PER (90
bullies I-PER -
, I-PER -
hating I-PER -
and I-PER -
hated I-PER -
by I-PER -
their I-PER (61)
crew I-PER 90)
. O -

The B-PER (62
captain I-PER 62)
, O -
while O -
a B-PER (91
competent I-PER -
seaman I-PER 91)
, O -
was O -
a O -
brute O -
in O -
his O -
treatment O -
of O -
his B-PER (63|(62)
men I-PER 63)|92)
. O -

He O -
knew O -
, O -
or O -
at O -
least O -
he O -
used O -
, O -
but O -
two O -
arguments O -
in O -
his O -
dealings O -
with O -
them O -
-- O -
a O -
belaying O -
pin O -
and O -
a O -
revolver O -
-- O -
nor O -
is O -
it O -
likely O -
that O -
the B-PER (63
motley I-PER -
aggregation I-PER 63)
he O -
signed O -
would O -
have O -
understood O -
aught O -
else O -
. O -

So O -
it O -
was O -
that O -
from O -
the O -
second O -
day O -
out O -
from O -
Freetown O -
John B-PER (12
Clayton I-PER 12)
and O -
his B-PER (37|(12)
young I-PER -
wife I-PER 37)
witnessed O -
scenes O -
upon O -
the O -
deck O -
of O -
the O -
Fuwalda O -
such O -
as O -
they O -
had O -
believed O -
were O -
never O -
enacted O -
outside O -
the O -
covers O -
of O -
printed O -
stories O -
of O -
the O -
sea O -
. O -

It O -
was O -
on O -
the O -
morning O -
of O -
the O -
second O -
day O -
that O -
the O -
first O -
link O -
was O -
forged O -
in O -
what O -
was O -
destined O -
to O -
form O -
a O -
chain O -
of O -
circumstances O -
ending O -
in O -
a O -
life O -
for O -
one O -
then O -
unborn O -
such O -
as O -
has O -
never O -
been O -
paralleled O -
in O -
the O -
history O -
of O -
man B-PER (65)
. O -

Two B-PER (66
sailors I-PER 66)
were O -
washing O -
down O -
the O -
decks O -
of O -
the O -
Fuwalda O -
, O -
the B-PER (67
first I-PER -
mate I-PER 67)
was O -
on O -
duty O -
, O -
and O -
the B-PER (62
captain I-PER 62)
had O -
stopped O -
to O -
speak O -
with O -
John B-PER (12
Clayton I-PER 12)
and O -
Lady B-PER (37
Alice O -
. O -

The B-PER (66
men I-PER 66)
were O -
working O -
backwards O -
toward O -
the O -
little O -
party O -
who O -
were O -
facing O -
away O -
from O -
the B-PER (63
sailors I-PER 63)|68)
. O -

Closer O -
and O -
closer O -
they O -
came O -
, O -
until O -
one O -
of O -
them O -
was O -
directly O -
behind O -
the B-PER (62
captain I-PER 62)
. O -

In O -
another O -
moment O -
he O -
would O -
have O -
passed O -
by O -
and O -
this O -
strange O -
narrative O -
would O -
never O -
have O -
been O -
recorded O -
. O -

But O -
just O -
that O -
instant O -
the B-PER (62
officer I-PER 62)
turned O -
to O -
leave O -
Lord B-PER (12)
and O -
Lady B-PER (37
Greystoke O -
, O -
and O -
, O -
as O -
he O -
did O -
so O -
, O -
tripped O -
against O -
the B-PER (69
sailor I-PER 69)
and O -
sprawled O -
headlong O -
upon O -
the O -
deck O -
, O -
overturning O -
the O -
water-pail O -
so O -
that O -
he O -
was O -
drenched O -
in O -
its O -
dirty O -
contents O -
. O -

For O -
an O -
instant O -
the O -
scene O -
was O -
ludicrous O -
; O -
but O -
only O -
for O -
an O -
instant O -
. O -

With O -
a O -
volley O -
of O -
awful O -
oaths O -
, O -
his O -
face O -
suffused O -
with O -
the O -
scarlet O -
of O -
mortification O -
and O -
rage O -
, O -
the B-PER (62
captain I-PER 62)
regained O -
his O -
feet O -
, O -
and O -
with O -
a O -
terrific O -
blow O -
felled O -
the B-PER (69
sailor I-PER 69)
to O -
the O -
deck O -
. O -

The B-PER (69
man I-PER 69)
was O -
small O -
and O -
rather O -
old O -
, O -
so O -
that O -
the O -
brutality O -
of O -
the O -
act O -
was O -
thus O -
accentuated O -
. O -

The B-PER (70
other I-PER -
seaman I-PER 70)
, O -
however O -
, O -
was O -
neither O -
old O -
nor O -
small O -
-- O -
a O -
huge O -
bear O -
of O -
a B-PER (71
man I-PER 71)
, O -
with O -
fierce O -
black O -
mustachios O -
, O -
and O -
a O -
great O -
bull O -
neck O -
set O -
between O -
massive O -
shoulders O -
. O -

As O -
he O -
saw O -
his B-PER (69|(70)
mate I-PER 69)
go O -
down O -
he O -
crouched O -
, O -
and O -
, O -
with O -
a O -
low O -
snarl O -
, O -
sprang O -
upon O -
the B-PER (62
captain I-PER 62)
crushing O -
him O -
to O -
his O -
knees O -
with O -
a O -
single O -
mighty O -
blow O -
. O -

From O -
scarlet O -
the B-PER (62
officer I-PER 62)
's O -
face O -
went O -
white O -
, O -
for O -
this O -
was O -
mutiny O -
; O -
and O -
mutiny O -
he O -
had O -
met O -
and O -
subdued O -
before O -
in O -
his O -
brutal O -
career O -
. O -

Without O -
waiting O -
to O -
rise O -
he O -
whipped O -
a O -
revolver O -
from O -
his O -
pocket O -
, O -
firing O -
point O -
blank O -
at O -
the B-PER (70
great I-PER -

; O -
but O -
, O -
quick O -
as O -
he O -
was O -
, O -
John B-PER (12
Clayton I-PER 12)
was O -
almost O -
as O -
quick O -
, O -
so O -
that O -
the O -
bullet O -
which O -
was O -
intended O -
for O -
the B-PER (70

's O -
heart O -
lodged O -
in O -
the B-PER (70

's O -
leg O -
instead O -
, O -
for O -
Lord B-PER (12

had O -
struck O -
down O -
the B-PER (62

Ere O -

intention O -

not O -

several O -

nor O -
did O -
the B-PER (62

accord O -

more O -
than O -

surliest O -
of O -

when O -
he O -
was O -

to O -
speak O -
to O -
them O -

They O -
took O -
their O -
meals O -
in O -

, O -
as O -
they O -
had O -
before O -
the O -
unfortunate O -
occurrence O -
; O -
but O -
the B-PER (62

was O -
careful O -
to O -
see O -
that O -
his O -
duties O -
never O -
permitted O -
him O -
to O -
eat O -
at O -
the O -

The B-PER (77

coarse B-PER (94

little O -
above O -
the B-PER (63

were O -

so O -
that O -
the B-PER (46
Claytons I-PER 46)
were O -
left O -
very O -
much O -
to O -
themselves O -
. O -

This O -
in O -
itself O -
accorded O -
perfectly O -
with O -
their O -
desires O -
, O -
but O -
it O -
also O -
rather O -
isolated O -
them O -
from O -
the O -
life O -
of O -
the O -
little O -
ship O -
so O -
that O -
they O -
were O -
unable O -
to O -
keep O -
in O -
touch O -
with O -
the O -
daily O -
happenings O -
which O -
were O -
to O -
culminate O -
so O -
soon O -
in O -

There O -
was O -
in O -

of O -
the O -
craft O -
that O -
undefinable O -
something O -

was O -

As O -
you O -

him O -

wonders O -
frequently O -
whether O -

without O -

slightly O -
mad O -
, O -

shameful O -

In O -
this O -

one O -

accomplish O -
some O -

that O -
the B-PER (7

deem O -

At O -

Within O -
six O -

So O -
to O -
Anthony B-PER (0)
life O -
was O -
a O -
struggle O -
against O -
death O -
, O -
that O -
waited O -
at O -
every O -
corner O -
. O -

It O -
was O -
as O -
a O -
concession O -
to O -
his O -
hypochondriacal O -
imagination O -
that O -
he O -
formed O -
the O -
habit O -
of O -
reading O -
in O -

-- O -
it O -
soothed O -
him O -

He O -
read O -

he O -
was O -

often O -
fell O -
asleep O -

His O -
favorite O -

until O -
he O -
was O -

was O -
his O -

; O -
enormous O -

a B-PER (63

considered O -

So O -
Anthony B-PER (0)
kept O -
up O -
a O -

with O -
a O -
half O -
dozen O -
" O -

it O -
was O -

new O -
stamp-books O -
or O -
packages O -
of O -

there O -
was O -
a O -
mysterious O -
fascination O -
in O -
transferring O -
his O -
acquisitions O -
interminably O -
from O -
one O -
book O -
to O -
another O -
. O -

His O -
stamps O -
were O -
his O -
greatest O -
happiness O -
and O -
he O -
bestowed O -
impatient O -
frowns O -
on O -
any B-PER (65

who I-PER -
interrupted I-PER -
him I-PER (0)

with O -
them O -
; O -
they O -
devoured O -
his O -

every O -

, O -
and O -
he O -
lay O -
awake O -
at O -
night O -
musing O -
untiringly O -
on O -
their O -
variety O -
and O -
many-colored O -
splendor O -

At O -
sixteen O -
he O -
had O -
lived O -
almost O -
entirely O -
within O -
himself O -
, O -
an B-PER (94
inarticulate I-PER -

, O -
thoroughly O -
un-American O -
, O -
and O -
politely O -
bewildered O -
by O -
his B-PER (66|(0)
contemporaries I-PER 66)
. O -

The O -
two O -
preceding O -
years O -
had O -
been O -
spent O -
in O -
Europe O -
with O -
a O -
private O -
tutor O -

he O -
went O -

there O -
was O -

His O -

He O -

He O -
became O -
an B-PER (102

Curiously O -

he O -
found O -

its O -

its O -

if O -
once O -

it O -

than O -
himself O -
? O -

Thus O -
, O -
and O -
thus O -
only O -
, O -
the O -
whole O -
place O -
had O -
properly O -
to O -
be O -
regarded O -
; O -
it O -
had O -
to O -
be O -
considered O -
not O -
so O -
much O -
as O -
a O -
workshop O -
for O -
artists B-PER (14)
, O -
but O -
as O -
a O -
frail O -
but O -
finished O -

A B-PER (15
man I-PER -
who I-PER -
stepped I-PER -
into I-PER -
its I-PER (1)
social I-PER -
atmosphere I-PER 15)
felt O -
as O -
if O -
he O -
had O -
stepped O -
into O -
a O -
written O -
comedy O -
. O -

More O -
especially O -
this O -
attractive O -
unreality O -
fell O -
upon O -
it O -
about O -
nightfall O -
, O -
when O -
the O -
extravagant O -
roofs O -
were O -
dark O -
against O -
the O -
afterglow O -
and O -
the O -
whole O -
insane O -
village O -
seemed O -
as O -
separate O -
as O -
a O -
drifting O -
cloud O -
. O -

This O -
again O -
was O -
more O -
strongly O -
true O -
of O -
the O -
many O -
nights O -
of O -
local O -
festivity O -
, O -
when O -
the O -
little O -
gardens O -
were O -
often O -
illuminated O -
, O -
and O -
the O -
big O -
Chinese O -
lanterns O -
glowed O -
in O -
the O -
dwarfish O -
trees O -
like O -
some O -
fierce O -
and O -
monstrous O -
fruit O -
. O -

And O -
this O -
was O -
strongest O -
of O -
all O -
on O -
one O -
particular O -
evening O -
, O -
still O -
vaguely O -
remembered O -
in O -
the O -
locality O -
, O -
of O -
which O -
the B-PER (9
auburn-haired I-PER -
poet I-PER 9)
was O -
the B-PER (95
hero I-PER 95)
. O -

It O -
was O -
not O -
by O -
any O -
means O -
the O -
only O -
evening O -
of O -
which O -
he O -
was O -
the B-PER (96
hero I-PER 96)
. O -

On O -
many O -
nights O -
those O -
passing O -
by O -
his O -
little O -
back O -
garden O -
might O -
hear O -
his O -
high O -
, O -
didactic O -
voice O -
laying O -
down O -
the O -
law O -
to O -
men B-PER (18)
and O -
particularly O -
to O -
women B-PER (19)
. O -

The O -
attitude O -
of O -
women B-PER (20)
in O -
such O -
cases O -
was O -
indeed O -
one O -
of O -
the O -
paradoxes O -
of O -
the O -
place O -
. O -

Most O -
of O -
the B-PER (22
women I-PER 22)|21)
were O -
of O -
the O -
kind O -
vaguely O -
called O -
emancipated O -
, O -
and O -
professed O -
some O -
protest O -
against O -
male O -
supremacy O -
. O -

Yet O -
these B-PER (23
new I-PER -
women I-PER 23)
would O -
always O -
pay O -
to O -
a B-PER (24
man I-PER 24)
the O -
extravagant O -
compliment O -
which O -
no B-PER (25
ordinary I-PER -
woman I-PER 25)
ever O -
pays O -
to O -
him O -
, O -
that O -
of O -
listening O -
while O -
he O -
is O -
talking O -
. O -

And O -
Mr. B-PER (9
Lucian O -
Gregory O -
, O -
the B-PER (88
red-haired I-PER -
poet I-PER 88)
, O -
was O -
really O -
( O -
in O -
some O -
sense O -
) O -
a B-PER (101
man I-PER -
worth O -
listening O -
to O -
, O -
even O -
if O -
one O -
only O -
laughed O -
at O -
the O -
end O -
of O -
it O -
. O -

He O -
put O -
the O -
old O -
cant O -
of O -
the O -
lawlessness O -
of O -
art O -
and O -
the O -
art O -
of O -
lawlessness O -
with O -
a O -
certain O -
impudent O -
freshness O -
which O -
gave O -
at O -
least O -
a O -
momentary O -
pleasure O -
. O -

He O -
was O -
helped O -
in O -
some O -
degree O -
by O -
the O -
arresting O -
oddity O -
of O -
his O -
appearance O -
, O -
which O -
he O -
worked O -
, O -
as O -
the O -
phrase O -
goes O -
, O -
for O -
all O -
it O -
was O -
worth O -
. O -

His O -
dark O -
red O -
hair O -
parted O -
in O -
the O -
middle O -
was O -
literally O -
like O -
a B-PER (26
woman I-PER 26)
’s O -
, O -
and O -
curved O -
into O -
the O -
slow O -
curls O -
of O -
a B-PER (27
virgin I-PER 27)
in O -
a O -
pre-Raphaelite O -
picture O -
. O -

From O -
within O -
this O -
almost O -
saintly O -
oval O -
, O -
however O -
, O -
his O -
face O -
projected O -
suddenly O -
broad O -
and O -
brutal O -
, O -
the O -
chin O -
carried O -
forward O -
with O -
a O -
look O -
of O -
cockney O -
contempt O -
. O -

This O -
combination O -
at O -
once O -
tickled O -
and O -
terrified O -
the O -
nerves O -
of O -
a O -
neurotic O -
population O -
. O -

He O -
seemed O -
like O -
a O -
walking O -
blasphemy O -
, O -
a O -
blend O -
of O -
the B-PER (28
angel I-PER 28)
and O -
the O -
ape O -
. O -

This O -
particular O -
evening O -
, O -
if O -
it O -
is O -
remembered O -
for O -
nothing O -
else O -
, O -
will O -
be O -
remembered O -
in O -
that O -
place O -
for O -
its O -
strange O -
sunset O -
. O -

It O -
looked O -
like O -
the O -
end O -
of O -
the O -
world O -
. O -

All O -
the O -
heaven O -
seemed O -
covered O -
with O -
a O -
quite O -
vivid O -
and O -
palpable O -
plumage O -
; O -
you O -
could O -
only O -
say O -
that O -
the O -
sky O -
was O -
full O -
of O -
feathers O -
, O -
and O -
of O -
feathers O -
that O -
almost O -
brushed O -
the O -
face O -
. O -

Across O -
the O -
great O -
part O -
of O -
the O -
dome O -
they O -
were O -
grey O -
, O -
with O -
the O -
strangest O -
tints O -
of O -
violet O -
and O -
mauve O -
and O -
an O -
unnatural O -
pink O -
or O -
pale O -
green O -
; O -
but O -
towards O -
the O -
west O -
the O -
whole O -
grew O -
past O -
description O -
, O -
transparent O -
and O -
passionate O -
, O -
and O -
the O -
last O -
red-hot O -
plumes O -
of O -
it O -
covered O -
up O -
the O -
sun O -
like O -
something O -
too O -
good O -
to O -
be O -
seen O -
. O -

The O -
whole O -
was O -
so O -
close O -
about O -
the O -
earth O -
, O -
as O -
to O -
express O -
nothing O -
but O -
a O -
violent O -
secrecy O -
. O -

The O -
very O -
empyrean O -
seemed O -
to O -
be O -
a O -
secret O -
. O -

It O -
expressed O -
that O -
splendid O -
smallness O -
which O -
is O -
the O -
soul O -
of O -
local O -
patriotism O -
. O -

The O -
very O -
sky O -
seemed O -
small O -
. O -

I O -
say O -
that O -
there O -
are O -
some B-PER (33
inhabitants I-PER -
who I-PER -
may I-PER -
remember I-PER -
the I-PER -
evening I-PER -
if I-PER -
only I-PER -
by I-PER -
that I-PER -
oppressive I-PER -
sky I-PER 33)
. O -

There O -
are O -
others O -
who O -
may O -
remember O -
it O -
because O -
it O -
marked O -
the O -
first O -
appearance O -
in O -
the O -
place O -
of O -
the O -
second O -
poet O -
of O -
Saffron O -
Park O -
. O -

For O -
a O -
long O -
time O -
the B-PER (9
red-haired I-PER -
revolutionary I-PER 9)
had O -
reigned O -
without O -
a B-PER (36
rival I-PER 36)
; O -
it O -
was O -
upon O -
the O -
night O -
of O -
the O -
sunset O -
that O -
his O -
solitude O -
suddenly O -
ended O -
. O -

The O -
new O -
poet O -
, O -
who O -
introduced O -
himself O -
by O -
the O -
name O -
of O -
Gabriel B-PER (35
Syme I-PER 35)|35)
was O -
a O -
very O -
mild-looking O -
mortal O -
, O -
with O -
a O -
fair O -
, O -
pointed O -
beard O -
and O -
faint O -
, O -
yellow O -
hair O -
. O -

But O -
an O -
impression O -
grew O -
that O -
he O -
was O -
less O -
meek O -
than O -
he O -
looked O -
. O -

He O -
signalised O -
his O -
entrance O -
by O -
differing O -
with O -
the B-PER (9
established I-PER -
poet I-PER 9)
, O -
Gregory B-PER (9)
, O -
upon O -
the O -
whole O -
nature O -
of O -
poetry O -
. O -

He O -
said O -
that O -
he O -
( O -
Syme B-PER (97)
) O -
was O -
poet B-PER (91
of I-PER -
law I-PER 91)
, O -
a B-PER (90
poet I-PER -
of I-PER -
order I-PER 90)
; O -
nay O -
, O -
he O -
said O -
he O -
was O -
a B-PER (89
poet I-PER -
of I-PER -
respectability I-PER 89)
. O -

So O -
all B-PER (37
the I-PER -
Saffron I-PER -
Parkers I-PER 37)
looked O -
at O -
him O -
as O -
if O -
he O -
had O -
that O -
moment O -
fallen O -
out O -
of O -
that O -
impossible O -
sky O -
. O -

, O -
Mr. B-PER (9

the B-PER (92

“ O -

in O -
his O -

upon O -

every B-PER (6

Margaret B-PER (0)

for O -
her O -
prettiness O -

Margaret B-PER (0)
had O -
never O -
thought O -
about O -

until O -
the O -

days O -
, O -
when O -
the O -
prospect O -
of O -
soon O -
losing O -

seemed O -
to O -
give O -
force O -
to O -
every O -
sweet O -
quality O -
and O -
charm O -
which O -
Edith B-PER (1)
possessed O -
. O -

They O -
had O -
been O -
talking O -
about O -

; O -
and O -
Captain B-PER (7

Edith B-PER (1)
seemed O -
to O -
consider O -
as O -
one O -
of O -

most O -
formidable O -
that O -
could O -
befall O -
her O -
in O -

Scotland O -

which O -
would O -
immediately O -
succeed O -

the O -
whispered O -
tone O -

latterly O -
become O -
more O -
drowsy O -

, O -
after O -
a O -
pause O -
of O -
a O -
few O -
minutes O -
, O -
found O -

as O -

that O -
in O -

of O -
the O -
buzz O -
in O -
the O -
next O -

Edith B-PER (1)

rolled O -
herself O -
up O -
into O -
a O -
soft O -
ball O -
of O -
muslin O -

silken O -
curls O -

and O -
gone O -
off O -
into O -
a O -
peaceful O -
little O -
after-dinner O -
nap O -
. O -

Margaret B-PER (0)
had O -
been O -
on O -
the O -
point O -
of O -
telling O -
her B-PER (1|(0)
cousin I-PER 1)
of O -
some O -
of O -
the O -
plans O -
and O -
visions O -
which O -
she O -
entertained O -
as O -
to O -
her O -
future O -
life O -
in O -
the O -
country O -
parsonage O -
, O -
where O -
her B-PER (11|(0)
father I-PER 11)
and O -
mother B-PER (12)
lived O -
; O -
and O -
where O -
her O -
bright O -
holidays O -
had O -
always O -

for O -
the O -
last O -
ten O -
years O -
her B-PER (13|(0)|(15
aunt I-PER -
Shaw B-PER 15)
's O -
house O -
had O -
been O -
considered O -
as O -
her O -
home O -
. O -

But O -
in O -
default O -
of O -
a B-PER (14
listener I-PER 14)
, O -
she O -
had O -
to O -
brood O -
over O -
the O -
change O -
in O -
her O -
life O -
silently O -
as O -
heretofore O -
. O -

It O -
was O -
a O -
happy O -
brooding O -
, O -
although O -
tinged O -
with O -
regret O -
at O -
being O -
separated O -
for O -
an O -
indefinite O -
time O -
from O -
her B-PER (15|(0)
gentle I-PER -
aunt I-PER 15)
and O -
dear B-PER (1
cousin I-PER 1)
. O -

As O -
she O -
thought O -
of O -
the O -
delight O -
of O -
filling O -
the O -
important O -
post O -
of O -
only O -
daughter O -
in O -
Helstone O -
parsonage O -
, O -
pieces O -
of O -
the O -
conversation O -
out O -
of O -
the O -
next O -
room O -
came O -
upon O -
her O -
ears O -
. O -

Her B-PER (0)|(15
aunt I-PER -
Shaw B-PER 15)
was O -
talking O -
to O -
the O -
five O -
or O -
six O -
ladies O -
who O -
had O -
been O -
dining O -
there O -
, O -
and O -
whose B-PER (19
husbands I-PER 19)
were O -
still O -
in O -
the O -
dining-room O -
. O -

They O -
were O -
the O -
familiar O -
acquaintances O -
of O -
the O -
house O -
; O -
neighbours O -
whom O -
Mrs. B-PER (15
Shaw O -
called O -
friends B-PER 54)|(52)
, O -
because O -
she O -
happened O -
to O -
dine O -
with O -
them O -
more O -
frequently O -
than O -
with O -
any B-PER (22
other I-PER -
people I-PER 22)
, O -
and O -
because O -
if O -
she O -
or O -
Edith B-PER (1)
wanted O -
anything O -
from O -
them O -
, O -
or O -
they O -
from O -
her O -
, O -
they O -
did O -
not O -
scruple O -
to O -
make O -
a O -
call O -
at O -
each B-PER (23|(18
other I-PER 18)
's O -
houses O -
before O -
luncheon O -
. O -

These B-PER (18
ladies I-PER 18)
and O -
their B-PER (19|(18)
husbands I-PER 19)
were O -
invited O -
, O -
in O -
their O -
capacity O -
of O -
friends B-PER (25)
, O -
to O -
eat O -
a O -
farewell O -
dinner O -
in O -
honour O -
of O -
Edith B-PER (1)
's O -
approaching O -
marriage O -
. O -

Edith B-PER (1)
had O -
rather O -
objected O -
to O -
this O -
arrangement O -
, O -
for O -
Captain B-PER (7
Lennox O -
was O -
expected O -
to O -
arrive O -
by O -
a O -
late O -
train O -
this O -
very O -
evening O -
; O -
but O -
, O -
although O -
she O -
was O -
a B-PER (57
spoiled I-PER -
child I-PER 57)
, O -
she O -
was O -
too O -
careless O -
and O -
idle O -
to O -
have O -
a O -
very O -
strong O -
will O -
of O -
her O -
own O -
, O -
and O -
gave O -
way O -
when O -
she O -
found O -
that O -
her B-PER (15|(1)
mother I-PER 15)
had O -
absolutely O -
ordered O -
those O -
extra O -
delicacies O -
of O -
the O -
season O -
which O -
are O -
always O -
supposed O -
to O -
be O -
efficacious O -
against O -
immoderate O -
grief O -
at O -
farewell O -
dinners O -
. O -

She O -
contented O -
herself O -
by O -
leaning O -
back O -
in O -
her O -
chair O -
, O -
merely O -
playing O -
with O -
the O -
food O -
on O -
her O -
plate O -
, O -
and O -
looking O -
grave O -
and O -
absent O -
; O -
while O -
all O -
around O -
her O -
were O -
enjoying O -
the O -
mots O -
of O -
Mr. B-PER (27
Grey O -
, O -
the O -
gentleman O -
who O -
always O -
took O -
the O -
bottom O -
of O -
the O -
table O -
at O -
Mrs. B-PER (15
Shaw O -
's O -
dinner O -
parties O -
, O -
and O -
asked O -
Edith B-PER (1)
to O -
give O -
them O -
some O -
music O -
in O -
the O -
drawing-room O -
. O -

Mr. B-PER (27
Grey O -
was O -
particularly O -
agreeable O -
over O -
this O -
farewell O -
dinner O -
, O -
and O -
the B-PER (19
gentlemen I-PER 19)
staid O -
down O -
stairs O -
longer O -
than O -
usual O -
. O -

It O -
was O -
very O -
well O -
they O -
did O -
-- O -
to O -
judge O -
from O -
the O -
fragments O -
of O -
conversation O -
which O -
Margaret B-PER (0)
overheard O -
. O -
' O -

I O -
suffered O -
too O -
much O -
myself O -
; O -
not O -
that O -
I O -
was O -
not O -
extremely O -
happy O -
with O -
the B-PER (29
poor I-PER -
dear I-PER -
General I-PER 29)
, O -
but O -
still O -
disparity O -
of O -
age O -
is O -
a O -
drawback O -
; O -
one O -
that O -
I O -
was O -
resolved O -
Edith B-PER (1)
should O -
not O -
have O -
to O -
encounter O -
. O -

Of O -
course O -
, O -
without O -
any O -
maternal O -
partiality O -
, O -
I O -
foresaw O -
that O -
the B-PER (1
dear I-PER -
child I-PER 1)
was O -
likely O -
to O -
marry O -
early O -
; O -
indeed O -
, O -
I O -
had O -
often O -
said O -
that O -
I O -
was O -
sure O -
she O -
would O -
be O -
married O -
before O -
she O -
was O -
nineteen O -
. O -

I O -
had O -
quite O -
a O -
prophetic O -
feeling O -
when O -
Captain B-PER (7
Lennox O -
' O -
-- O -
and O -
here O -
the O -
voice O -
dropped O -
into O -
a O -
whisper O -
, O -
but O -
Margaret B-PER (0)
could O -
easily O -
supply O -
the O -
blank O -
. O -

The O -
course O -
of O -
true O -
love O -
in O -
Edith B-PER (1)
's O -
case O -
had O -
run O -
remarkably O -
smooth O -
. O -

Mrs. B-PER (15
Shaw O -
had O -
given O -
way O -
to O -
the O -
presentiment O -
, O -
as O -
she O -
expressed O -
it O -
; O -
and O -
had O -
rather O -
urged O -
on O -
the O -
marriage O -
, O -
although O -
it O -
was O -
below O -
the O -
expectations O -
which O -
many O -
of O -
Edith B-PER (1)
's O -
acquaintances O -
had O -
formed O -
for O -
her O -
, O -
a B-PER (59
young I-PER -
and I-PER -
pretty I-PER -
heiress I-PER 59)
. O -

But O -
Mrs. B-PER (15
Shaw O -
said O -
that O -
her B-PER (1|(15)
only I-PER -
child I-PER 1)
should O -
marry O -
for O -
love O -
, O -
-- O -
and O -
sighed O -
emphatically O -
, O -
as O -
if O -
love O -
had O -
not O -
been O -
her O -
motive O -
for O -
marrying O -
the B-PER (29
General I-PER 29)
. O -

Mrs. B-PER (15
Shaw O -
enjoyed O -
the O -
romance O -
of O -
the O -
present O -
engagement O -
rather O -
more O -
than O -
her B-PER (1|(15)
daughter I-PER 1)
. O -

Not O -
but O -
that O -
Edith B-PER (1)
was O -
very O -
thoroughly O -
and O -
properly O -
in O -
love O -
; O -
still O -
she O -
would O -
certainly O -
have O -
preferred O -
a O -
good O -
house O -
in O -
Belgravia O -
, O -
to O -
all O -
the O -
picturesqueness O -
of O -
the O -
life O -
which O -
Captain B-PER (7
Lennox O -
described O -
at O -
Corfu O -
. O -

The O -
very O -
parts O -
which O -
made O -
Margaret B-PER (0)
glow O -
as O -
she O -
listened O -
, O -
Edith B-PER (1)
pretended O -
to O -
shiver O -
and O -
shudder O -
at O -
; O -
partly O -
for O -
the O -
pleasure O -
she O -
had O -
in O -
being O -
coaxed O -
out O -
of O -
her O -
dislike O -
by O -
her B-PER (7|(1)
fond I-PER -
lover I-PER 7)
, O -
and O -
partly O -
because O -
anything O -
of O -
a O -
gipsy O -
or O -
make-shift O -
life O -
was O -
really O -
distasteful O -
to O -
her O -
. O -

Yet O -
had O -
any B-PER (22
one I-PER 22)
come O -
with O -
a O -
fine O -
house O -
, O -
and O -
a O -
fine O -
estate O -
, O -
and O -
a O -
fine O -
title O -
to O -
boot O -
, O -
Edith B-PER (1)
would O -
still O -
have O -
clung O -
to O -
Captain B-PER (7
Lennox O -
while O -
the O -
temptation O -
lasted O -
; O -
when O -
it O -
was O -
over O -
, O -
it O -
is O -
possible O -
she O -
might O -
have O -
had O -
little O -
qualms O -
of O -
ill-concealed O -
regret O -
that O -
Captain B-PER (7
Lennox O -
could O -
not O -
have O -
united O -
in O -
his B-PER (7|(7)
person I-PER 7)
everything O -
that O -
was O -
desirable O -
. O -

In O -
this O -
she O -
was O -

that O -

John B-PER (6
Reed I-PER 6)
was O -
a O -
schoolboy O -
of O -
fourteen O -
years O -

; O -
four O -

I O -
, O -
for O -
I O -
was O -

ten O -
: O -
large O -
and O -
stout O -
for O -
his O -
age O -
, O -
with O -
a O -
dingy O -
and O -
unwholesome O -
skin O -
; O -
thick O -
lineaments O -
in O -
a O -
spacious O -
visage O -
, O -
heavy O -
limbs O -
and O -
large O -
extremities O -
. O -

He O -
gorged O -
himself O -
habitually O -
at O -
table O -
, O -
which O -
made O -
him O -
bilious O -
, O -
and O -
gave O -
him O -
a O -
dim O -
and O -
bleared O -
eye O -

flabby O -
cheeks O -

He O -
ought O -
now O -
to O -
have O -
been O -
at O -
school O -
; O -
but O -
his B-PER (1|(6)

had O -
taken O -
him O -
home O -
for O -
a O -
month O -
or O -
two O -

" O -
on O -
account O -
of O -
his O -
delicate O -
health O -
. O -
" O -

Mr. B-PER (52
Miles O -
, O -
the B-PER (68
master I-PER 68)
, O -
affirmed O -
that O -
he O -
would O -
do O -
very O -
well O -
if O -
he O -
had O -
fewer O -
cakes O -
and O -
sweetmeats O -
sent O -
him O -
from O -
home O -
; O -
but O -
the B-PER (1
mother I-PER 1)
's O -
heart O -
turned O -
from O -
an O -
opinion O -
so O -
harsh O -
, O -
and O -
inclined O -
rather O -
to O -
the O -
more O -
refined O -
idea O -
that O -
John B-PER (6)
's O -
sallowness O -
was O -
owing O -
to O -
over-application O -
and O -
, O -
perhaps O -
, O -
to O -
pining O -
after O -
home O -
. O -

John B-PER (6)
had O -
not O -
much O -
affection O -
for O -
his B-PER (1|(6)
mother I-PER 1)
and O -
sisters B-PER (48)
, O -
and O -
an O -
antipathy O -
to O -
me O -
. O -

He O -
bullied O -

punished O -
me O -
; O -
not O -
two O -

three O -
times O -
in O -
the O -

once O -

twice O -
in O -
the O -

but O -
continually O -
: O -
every O -

had O -
feared O -
him O -

every O -
morsel O -
of O -
flesh O -
in O -
my O -
bones O -
shrank O -
when O -
he O -
came O -
near O -
. O -

There O -
were O -
moments O -
when O -
I O -
was O -
bewildered O -
by O -
the O -
terror O -
he O -
inspired O -
, O -
because O -
I O -
had O -
no O -
appeal O -
whatever O -
against O -
either O -
his O -
menaces O -
or O -
his O -
inflictions O -
; O -
the B-PER (53

did O -
not O -
like O -
to O -
offend O -

taking O -
my O -

Mrs. B-PER (1

both O -

John B-PER (6)

I O -
came O -
up O -
to O -
his O -
chair O -
: O -
he O -
spent O -
some O -
three O -
minutes O -
in O -
thrusting O -
out O -
his O -
tongue O -
at O -
me O -
as O -

without O -

I O -
knew O -

would O -
soon O -

while O -
dreading O -
the O -
blow O -

I O -
mused O -
on O -
the O -
disgusting O -

ugly O -
appearance O -
of O -
him O -

would O -
presently O -
deal O -

I O -

all O -

struck O -
suddenly O -

strongly O -

I O -
tottered O -

on O -

This O -
double O -
row O -
of O -

sat O -
at O -
the O -
foot O -
of O -
the O -
rather O -
sharp O -
slope O -
from O -

at O -

, O -
on O -
the O -
slow O -
climb O -
of O -
the O -
valley O -
towards O -
Selby O -
. O -

The O -
houses O -
themselves O -
were O -
substantial O -
and O -
very O -
decent O -
. O -

One O -
could O -
walk O -
all O -
round O -
, O -
seeing O -
little O -
front O -
gardens O -
with O -
auriculas O -

the O -

But O -
that O -
was O -
outside O -
; O -
that O -
was O -
the O -

The O -
dwelling-room O -
, O -
the O -
kitchen O -
, O -
was O -
at O -
the O -
back O -
of O -
the O -
house O -
, O -
facing O -
inward O -
between O -
the O -
blocks O -
, O -
looking O -
at O -
a O -
scrubby O -
back O -
garden O -
, O -
and O -
then O -
at O -
the O -
ash-pits O -
. O -

And O -
between O -
the O -
rows O -
, O -
between O -
the O -
long O -
lines O -
of O -
ash-pits O -
, O -
went O -
the O -
alley O -
, O -
where O -
the B-PER (66
children I-PER 66)
played O -
and O -
the B-PER (67
women I-PER 67)
gossiped O -
and O -
the B-PER (68
men I-PER 68)
smoked O -
. O -

So O -
, O -
the O -
actual O -
conditions O -
of O -
living O -
in O -
the O -
Bottoms O -
, O -
that O -
was O -
so O -
well O -
built O -
and O -
that O -
looked O -
so O -
nice O -
, O -
were O -
quite O -
unsavoury O -
because O -
people B-PER (69)
must O -
live O -
in O -
the O -
kitchen O -
, O -
and O -
the O -
kitchens O -
opened O -
on O -
to O -
that O -
nasty O -
alley O -
of O -
ash-pits O -
. O -

Mrs. B-PER (70
Morel O -
was O -
not O -
anxious O -
to O -
move O -
into O -
the O -
Bottoms O -
, O -
which O -
was O -
already O -
twelve O -
years O -
old O -
and O -
on O -
the O -
downward O -
path O -
, O -
when O -
she O -
descended O -
to O -
it O -
from O -
Bestwood O -
. O -

But O -
it O -
was O -
the O -
best O -
she O -
could O -
do O -
. O -

Moreover O -
, O -
she O -
had O -
an O -
end O -
house O -
in O -
one O -
of O -
the O -
top O -
blocks O -
, O -
and O -
thus O -
had O -
only B-PER (73
one I-PER -
neighbour I-PER 73)
; O -
on O -
the O -
other O -
side O -
an O -
extra O -
strip O -
of O -
garden O -
. O -

And O -
, O -
having O -
an O -
end O -
house O -
, O -
she O -
enjoyed O -
a O -
kind O -
of O -
aristocracy O -
among O -
the O -
other O -
women O -
of O -
the O -
“ O -
between O -
” O -
houses O -
, O -
because O -
her O -
rent O -
was O -
five O -
shillings O -
and O -
sixpence O -
instead O -
of O -
five O -
shillings O -
a O -
week O -
. O -

But O -
this O -
superiority O -
in O -
station O -
was O -
not O -
much O -
consolation O -
to O -
Mrs. B-PER (70
Morel O -
. O -

She O -
was O -
thirty-one O -
years O -
old O -
, O -
and O -
had O -
been O -
married O -
eight O -
years O -
. O -

A B-PER (111

, I-PER -
of I-PER -
delicate I-PER -

but I-PER -
resolute I-PER -
bearing I-PER 111)
, O -
she O -
shrank O -
a O -
little O -
from O -
the O -
first O -
contact O -
with O -
the O -
Bottoms O -
women O -
. O -

She O -
came O -
down O -
in O -
the O -
July O -
, O -
and O -
in O -
the O -
September O -
expected O -
her B-PER (78|(70)

Her B-PER (79|(70)

was O -
a B-PER (112
miner I-PER 112)
. O -

They O -
had O -
only O -
been O -
in O -
their O -
new O -
home O -
three O -
weeks O -
when O -
the O -

, O -
or O -

, O -
began O -
. O -

Morel B-PER (79)
, O -
she O -
knew O -
, O -

sure O -
to O -
make O -
a O -
holiday O -
of O -
it O -
. O -

He O -
went O -
off O -
early O -
on O -
the O -
Monday O -
morning O -
, O -
the O -
day O -
of O -
the O -
fair O -
. O -

The B-PER (81
two I-PER -

were O -
highly O -
excited O -
. O -

William B-PER (82)
, O -
a B-PER (108

of I-PER -

, O -
fled O -
off O -
immediately O -
after O -

, O -
to O -
prowl O -
round O -
the O -

, O -
leaving O -
Annie B-PER (84)

who O -
was O -

to O -

all O -

to O -

Mrs. B-PER (70
Morel O -
did O -
her O -
work O -
. O -

She O -
scarcely O -
knew O -
her B-PER (85|(70)
neighbours I-PER 85)
yet O -
, O -
and O -
knew O -
no O -
one O -
with O -
whom O -
to O -
trust O -
the B-PER (84
little I-PER -

. O -

So O -
she O -
promised O -
to O -

her O -

the O -

William B-PER (82)

He O -
was O -
a B-PER (113

“ O -

he O -

rushing O -
in O -

“ O -

the B-PER (70

“ O -

he O -
cried O -
, O -
his B-PER (88|(82)

staring O -
at O -
her O -
in O -
indignation O -
. O -

“ O -

“ O -

“ O -
They O -

the B-PER (82

half O -

half O -
shouted O -
. O -

“ O -
You O -
wo O -

said O -
the B-PER (70

“ O -

The B-PER (82

began O -
hastily O -
to O -
lay O -

table O -
, O -
and O -
directly O -
the B-PER (90

down O -
. O -

They O -
were O -
eating O -
batter-pudding O -

, O -
when O -
the B-PER (82
boy I-PER 82)
jumped O -
off O -
his O -

and O -
stood O -
perfectly O -
stiff O -
. O -

Some O -
distance O -
away O -
could O -
be O -

of O -
a O -
merry-go-round O -

and O -
the O -
tooting O -
of O -
a O -

. O -

His O -
face O -
quivered O -
as O -
he O -
looked O -
at O -
his B-PER (70|(82)
mother I-PER 70)
. O -

“ O -
I O -
told O -

“ O -

cried O -
the B-PER (70

in O -
a O -
breath O -
. O -

The B-PER (82
boy I-PER 82)
came O -
back O -
, O -
bitterly O -
disappointed O -

for O -
his O -
twopence O -

then O -
went O -
off O -

“ O -

said O -
the B-PER (70

And O -
later O -
in O -
the O -

trudged O -
up O -

Mrs. B-PER (70|(93)

The B-PER (70

Presently O -
the B-PER (82

For O -

There O -

no O -

I O -
will O -
tell O -
you O -
plainly O -
that O -
I O -
have O -
a O -
great O -
hope O -
; O -
and O -
I O -
bring O -
it O -
to O -
you O -
to O -
be O -
tested O -
. O -

It O -
is O -
this O -
: O -
that O -
this O -
terrible O -
dumb O -
question O -
is O -
its O -
own O -
reply O -
; O -
that O -
it O -
is O -
not O -
the O -
sentence O -
of O -
death O -
we O -
think O -
it O -
, O -
but O -
, O -
from O -
the O -
very O -
extremity O -
of O -
its O -
darkness O -
, O -
the O -
most O -
solemn O -
prophecy O -
which O -
the O -
world O -
has O -
known O -
of O -
the O -
Hope O -
to O -
come O -
. O -

I O -
dare O -
make O -
my O -
meaning O -
no O -
clearer O -
, O -
but O -
will O -
only O -
tell O -
my O -
story O -
. O -

It O -
will O -
, O -
perhaps O -
, O -
seem O -
to O -
you O -
as O -
foul O -
and O -
dark O -
as O -
this O -
thick O -
vapor O -
about O -
us O -
, O -
and O -
as O -
pregnant O -
with O -
death O -
; O -
but O -
if O -
your O -
eyes O -
are O -
free O -
as O -
mine O -
are O -
to O -
look O -
deeper O -
, O -
no O -
perfume-tinted O -
dawn O -
will O -
be O -
so O -
fair O -
with O -
promise O -
of O -
the O -
day O -
that O -
shall O -
surely O -
come O -
. O -

My O -
story O -
is O -
very O -
simple O -
, O -
-- O -
Only O -
what O -
I O -
remember O -
of O -
the O -
life O -
of O -
one O -
of O -
these B-PER (68
men I-PER 68)|67)
, O -
-- O -
a O -
furnace-tender O -
in O -
one O -
of O -
Kirby B-PER (70)
& O -
John B-PER (71)

rolling-mills O -
, O -
-- O -
Hugh B-PER (138

. O -

You O -
know O -
the O -
mills O -
? O -

They O -
took O -
the O -
great O -
order O -
for O -
the O -
lower O -
Virginia O -
railroads O -
there O -
last O -
winter O -
; O -
run O -
usually O -
with O -
about O -
a B-PER (77
thousand I-PER -
men I-PER 77)
. O -

I O -
can O -
not O -
tell O -
why O -
I O -
choose O -
the O -
half-forgotten O -
story O -
of O -
this B-PER (67
Wolfe I-PER 67)
more O -
than O -
that O -
of O -
myriads O -
of O -
these B-PER (79
furnace-hands I-PER 78)|79)
. O -

Perhaps O -
because O -
there O -
is O -
a O -
secret O -
, O -
underlying O -
sympathy O -
between O -
that O -
story O -
and O -
this O -
day O -
with O -
its O -
impure O -
fog O -
and O -
thwarted O -
sunshine O -
, O -
-- O -
or O -
perhaps O -
simply O -
for O -
the O -
reason O -
that O -
this O -
house O -
is O -
the O -
one O -
where O -
the B-PER (80
Wolfes I-PER 80)
lived O -
. O -

There O -
were O -
the B-PER (81

and O -
son B-PER (67)
, O -
-- O -
both O -

, O -

in O -

The O -

The B-PER (82

The B-PER (81

, O -
like O -
many O -
of O -
the O -

, O -
was O -
Welsh B-PER (88)

half O -

his O -

in O -
the O -

You O -
may O -
pick O -

Cornish B-PER (92

of O -
the B-PER (93

, O -
any O -

They O -
are O -
a O -
trifle O -
more O -
filthy O -
; O -
their O -
muscles O -
are O -
not O -
so O -
brawny O -
; O -
they O -

When O -
they O -

they O -
neither O -

A O -

in O -
the B-PER (95

It O -
is O -
nearly O -
thirty O -
years O -
since O -
the B-PER (82
Wolfes I-PER 82)
lived O -
here O -
. O -

Their O -
lives O -
were O -
like O -
those O -
of O -
their B-PER (96|(82)

: O -
incessant O -

occasional O -

in O -

Is O -

One O -
rainy O -

about O -
eleven O -

, O -
a O -
crowd O -
of O -
half-clothed B-PER (108

stopped O -
outside O -
of O -

They O -

“ O -

The O -

her O -

her O -

She O -
wore O -
a O -

a O -

When O -
she O -
walked O -

one O -

see O -
that O -
she O -
was O -
deformed O -

almost O -
a B-PER (125

She O -
trod O -
softly O -

so O -

went O -
through O -

There O -

over O -
her O -

prepared O -

her O -

It O -
was O -
the O -

Perhaps O -
the B-PER (112

heart O -
. O -

But O -
, O -
whereas O -
a O -
yearly O -
month O -
or O -
so O -
at O -
Nauheim O -
tuned O -
him O -
up O -
to O -
exactly O -
the O -
right O -
pitch O -
for O -
the O -
rest O -
of O -
the O -
twelvemonth O -
, O -
the O -
two O -
months O -
or O -
so O -
were O -
only O -
just O -
enough O -
to O -
keep O -
poor O -
Florence B-PER (5)
alive O -
from O -
year O -
to O -
year O -
. O -

The O -
reason O -
for O -
his O -
heart O -
was O -
, O -
approximately O -
, O -
polo O -
, O -
or O -
too O -
much O -
hard O -
sportsmanship O -
in O -
his O -
youth O -
. O -

The O -
reason O -
for O -
poor O -
Florence B-PER (5)
's O -
broken O -
years O -
was O -
a O -
storm O -
at O -
sea O -
upon O -
our O -
first O -
crossing O -
to O -
Europe O -
, O -
and O -
the O -
immediate O -
reasons O -
for O -
our O -
imprisonment O -
in O -
that O -
continent O -
were O -
doctor B-PER (20)
's O -
orders O -
. O -

They O -
said O -
that O -
even O -
the O -
short O -
Channel O -
crossing O -
might O -
well O -
kill O -
the B-PER (5
poor I-PER -
thing I-PER 5)
. O -

When O -
we O -
all O -
first O -
met O -
, O -
Captain B-PER (18
Ashburnham O -
, O -
home O -
on O -
sick O -
leave O -
from O -
an O -
India O -
to O -
which O -
he O -
was O -
never O -
to O -
return O -
, O -
was O -
thirty-three O -
; O -
Mrs B-PER (25
Ashburnham O -
Leonora O -
-- O -
was O -
thirty-one O -
. O -

I O -
was O -
thirty-six O -
and O -
poor O -
Florence B-PER (5)
thirty O -
. O -

Thus O -
today O -
Florence B-PER (5)
would O -
have O -
been O -
thirty-nine O -
and O -
Captain B-PER (18

forty-two O -
; O -
whereas O -
I O -
am O -
forty-five O -
and O -
Leonora B-PER (25)
forty O -
. O -

You O -
will O -
perceive O -
, O -
therefore O -
, O -
that O -
our O -
friendship O -
has O -
been O -
a O -
young-middle-aged O -
affair O -
, O -
since O -
we O -
were O -

as O -
you O -

expect O -
, O -
from O -
the B-PER (29

accompanied O -

long O -
conversations O -
full O -
of O -
worldly O -
wisdom O -
that O -
Leonora B-PER (25)
has O -
reported O -
to O -
me O -
since O -
their O -
deaths O -
. O -

And O -
is O -
it O -
possible O -
to O -
imagine O -
that O -
during O -
our O -
prescribed O -
walks O -
in O -
Nauheim O -
and O -
the O -
neighbourhood O -
she O -
found O -
time O -
to O -
carry O -
on O -
the O -
protracted O -
negotiations O -
which O -
she O -
did O -
carry O -
on O -
between O -
Edward B-PER (18
Ashburnham I-PER 18)
and O -
his B-PER (25|(18)
wife I-PER 25)
? O -

And O -
is O -
n't O -
it O -
incredible O -
that O -
during O -
all O -
that O -
time O -
Edward B-PER (18)
and O -
Leonora B-PER (25)
never O -
spoke O -
a O -
word O -
to O -
each O -
other O -
in O -
private O -
? O -

What O -
is O -
one O -
to O -
think O -
of O -
humanity O -
? O -

For O -
I O -
swear O -
to O -
you O -
that O -
they O -
were O -
the B-PER (123
model I-PER -
couple I-PER 123)
. O -

He O -
was O -
as O -
devoted O -
as O -
it O -
was O -
possible O -
to O -
be O -
without O -
appearing O -
fatuous O -
. O -

So O -
well O -
set O -
up O -
, O -
with O -
such O -
honest O -
blue O -
eyes O -
, O -
such O -
a O -
touch O -
of O -
stupidity O -
, O -
such O -
a O -
warm O -
goodheartedness O -
! O -

And O -
she O -
-- O -
so O -
tall O -
, O -
so O -
splendid O -
in O -
the O -
saddle O -
, O -
so O -
fair O -
! O -

Yes O -
, O -
Leonora B-PER (25)
was O -
extraordinarily O -
fair O -
and O -
so O -
extraordinarily O -
the O -
real O -
thing O -
that O -
she O -
seemed O -
too O -
good O -
to O -
be O -
true O -
. O -

You O -

, O -
I O -
mean O -

even O -
just O -
to O -
the O -
saving O -

of O -
insolence O -
that O -
seems O -
to O -
be O -
necessary O -
. O -

To O -
have O -
all O -
that O -
and O -
to O -
be O -
all O -
that O -

No O -
, O -
it O -

And O -
yet O -
, O -
only O -
this O -
afternoon O -
, O -
talking O -
over O -
the O -

she O -
said O -
to O -
me O -
: O -
" O -
Once O -
I O -
tried O -
to O -
have O -
a B-PER (116

at O -
the O -

so O -
utterly O -
worn O -
out O -
that O -
I O -
had O -
to O -
send O -
him O -
away O -

" O -

That O -
struck O -
me O -
as O -
the O -
most O -
amazing O -
thing O -
I O -
had O -
ever O -
heard O -

She O -
said O -

Such O -
a B-PER (116
dear I-PER -
fellow I-PER 116)
! O -

And O -
I O -
was O -
saying O -
to O -
myself O -

fiercely O -

hissing O -
it O -
between O -
my O -

as O -
they O -

really O -
clenching O -

Eleven O -

had O -
to O -

And O -
then O -
suddenly O -
the O -
bitterness O -
of O -
the O -
endless O -

of O -
the O -

it O -
fell O -
on O -
me O -

Yes O -

With O -
the O -

Southern O -

, O -
the O -
increase O -
of O -
mulattoes B-PER (2)
has O -
been O -
very O -
great O -
. O -

Society O -
does O -
not O -
frown O -
upon O -
the O -
man O -
who O -
sits O -
with O -
his B-PER (4|(3)
half-white I-PER -
child I-PER 4)
upon O -
his O -
knee O -
whilst O -
the B-PER (5
mother I-PER 5)
stands O -
, O -
a B-PER (127
slave I-PER 127)
, O -
behind O -
his O -

In O -
nearly O -
all O -

of O -

the B-PER (8

to O -
more O -
than O -
one O -
in O -
four O -
of O -
the B-PER (9
slave I-PER -
population I-PER 9)
. O -

This O -
fact O -
is O -
of O -
itself O -
the O -
best O -
evidence O -
of O -
the O -
degraded O -
and O -
immoral O -
condition O -
of O -
the O -
relation O -
of O -
master B-PER (10)
and O -
slave B-PER (11)
. O -

Throughout O -
the O -
Southern O -
States O -
, O -
there O -
is O -
a O -
class O -
of O -
slaves B-PER 14)
who O -
, O -
in O -
most O -
of O -
the O -
towns O -
, O -
are O -
permitted O -
to O -
hire O -
their O -
time O -
from O -
their B-PER (15|(14)
owners I-PER 15)
, O -
and O -
who O -
are O -
always O -
expected O -
to O -
pay O -
a O -
high O -
price O -
. O -

This O -
class O -
is O -
the B-PER (134
mulatto I-PER -
women I-PER 134)
, O -
distinguished O -
for O -
their O -
fascinating O -
beauty O -
. O -

The O -
handsomest O -
of O -
these O -
usually O -
pay O -
the O -
greatest O -
amount O -
for O -
their O -
time O -
. O -

Many O -
of O -
these B-PER (16
women I-PER 16)|17)
are O -
the O -
favorites O -
of O -
men O -
of O -
property O -
and O -
standing O -
, O -
who O -
furnish O -
them O -
with O -
the O -

of O -
compensating O -
their B-PER (19|(17)

, O -
and O -
not O -
a O -
few O -
are O -
dressed O -
in O -
the O -
most O -
extravagant O -
manner O -
. O -

When O -
we O -
take O -
into O -
consideration O -
the O -
fact O -
that O -
no O -
safeguard O -
is O -
thrown O -
around O -
virtue O -
, O -
and O -
no O -
inducement O -
held O -
out O -
to O -
slave-women B-PER (21)
to O -
be O -
pure O -
and O -
chaste O -
, O -
we O -
will O -
not O -
be O -
surprised O -
when O -
told O -
that O -
immorality O -
and O -
vice O -
pervade O -
the O -
cities O -
and O -
towns O -
of O -
the O -
South O -
to O -
an O -
extent O -
unknown O -
in O -
the O -
Northern O -
States O -
. O -

Indeed O -
, O -
many O -
of O -
the B-PER (26
slave-women I-PER 26)|25)
have O -
no O -
higher O -
aspiration O -
than O -
that O -
of O -
becoming O -
the O -
finely-dressed O -
mistress O -
of O -
some B-PER (28
white I-PER -
man I-PER 28)|27)
. O -

At O -
negro O -
balls O -
and O -
parties O -
, O -
this O -
class O -
of O -
women B-PER 29)
usually O -
make O -
the O -
most O -
splendid O -
appearance O -

are O -
eagerly O -
sought O -

who O -
might O -

that O -
she O -

the O -
daughter O -
of O -
an B-PER (37

Although O -

the O -
time O -
of O -
which O -
we O -

no B-PER (38
one I-PER 38)
felt O -
like O -
disputing O -
with O -
her O -
when O -
she O -
urged O -
her O -
claim O -
to O -
her O -
relationship O -
with O -
the B-PER (39
Anglo-Saxon I-PER 39)
. O -

In O -
her O -
younger O -
days O -
, O -
Agnes B-PER (35)
had O -
been O -
a O -

a B-PER (40

and O -
in O -

by O -
this B-PER (40

the B-PER (35

betook O -
herself O -

the O -
business O -
of O -
a B-PER (42

, O -
and O -
was O -
considered O -

The B-PER (35

however O -
, O -
was O -
very O -
choice O -
of O -
her B-PER (41|(35)

, O -
and O -
would O -
allow O -
them O -
to O -
perform O -
no O -
labor O -
that O -
would O -
militate O -
against O -
their O -
lady-like O -

Agnes B-PER (35)
early O -

Her O -
notoriety O -
as O -
a B-PER (45

Miss B-PER (1

of O -

; O -

but O -
for O -
fear O -
of O -
her B-PER (1|(13)

, O -
would O -
have O -
gone O -
off O -

Such O -

allowed O -
to O -

Honest B-PER (13

But O -
why O -
speak O -
about O -
her O -

It O -
is O -
probable O -
that O -
we O -

not O -

as O -
we O -
are O -
to O -
see O -
a O -
great O -

of O -
Amelia B-PER (14)

there O -
is O -
no O -
harm O -
in O -

at O -
the O -
outset O -
of O -
our O -
acquaintance O -

that O -
she O -
was O -
a B-PER (93

in O -
villains B-PER (73

no O -

indeed O -
I O -

Some O -

It O -
is O -
a O -

of O -
driving O -
off O -

Whenever O -

bringing O -

whenever O -
my O -
hypos O -
get O -
such O -
an O -
upper O -

that O -
it O -
requires O -

to O -
prevent O -
me O -
from O -
deliberately O -
stepping O -

the O -

methodically O -
knocking O -

There O -

if O -
a B-PER (66

the O -

Why O -
upon O -
your O -
first O -
voyage O -
as O -
a B-PER (85

, O -
did O -
you O -
yourself O -

such O -
a O -

, O -
when O -

you O -

out O -

Why O -
did O -
the B-PER (91

hold O -
the O -

Why O -
did O -
the B-PER (93

, O -
and O -
own O -

of O -

? O -

Surely O -
all O -
this O -
is O -
not O -
without O -
meaning O -
. O -

And O -
still O -
deeper O -
the O -
meaning O -
of O -
that O -
story O -
of O -
Narcissus B-PER (96)
, O -
who O -
because O -
he O -
could O -
not O -
grasp O -
the O -

mild O -
image O -

saw O -
in O -
the O -

plunged O -

was O -
drowned O -

But O -
that O -
same O -
image O -
, O -
we O -
ourselves O -
see O -
in O -
all O -
rivers O -

oceans O -
. O -

It O -
is O -
the O -
image O -
of O -
the O -
ungraspable O -
phantom O -
of O -

; O -
and O -
this O -
is O -
the O -

all O -

Now O -

when O -
I O -

that O -
I O -
am O -

No O -
, O -
when O -
I O -

True O -

they O -
rather O -
order O -
me O -
about O -
some O -

and O -
make O -
me O -
jump O -
from O -
spar O -
to O -
spar O -
, O -
like O -
a O -

a O -

. O -

And O -
at O -
first O -
, O -
this O -
sort O -
of O -
thing O -
is O -
unpleasant O -
enough O -
. O -

It O -
touches O -
one O -
's O -
sense O -
of O -
honor O -
, O -
particularly O -
if O -
you O -
come O -
of O -
an B-PER (127

And O -
more O -
than O -
all O -
, O -
if O -
just O -
previous O -
to O -
putting O -
your O -
hand O -
into O -
the O -
tar-pot O -
, O -
you O -
have O -
been O -
lording O -

making O -

The O -
transition O -
is O -
a O -
keen O -
one O -
, O -
I O -
assure O -
you O -
, O -
from O -
a B-PER (138
schoolmaster I-PER 138)
to O -
a B-PER (137

, O -
and O -
requires O -
a O -

decoction O -
of O -
Seneca B-PER (139)

the B-PER (140

to O -
enable O -
you O -
to O -

bear O -
it O -

But O -
even O -
this O -
wears O -
off O -
in O -
time O -
. O -

What O -
of O -
it O -
, O -
if O -
some B-PER (142

orders O -
me O -

What O -
does O -
that O -
indignity O -

, O -
I O -

in O -

Do O -
you O -
think O -
the B-PER (144

Gabriel B-PER (144)
thinks O -
anything O -
the O -
less O -
of O -

because O -
I O -
promptly O -
and O -
respectfully O -
obey O -
that B-PER (142

in O -
that O -
particular O -
instance O -
? O -

Who O -
ai O -
n't O -
a B-PER (145

? O -

Tell O -
me O -
that O -
. O -

Well O -
, O -
then O -
, O -
however O -
the B-PER (142
old I-PER -
sea-captains I-PER 142)
may O -
order O -
me O -
about O -
-- O -
however O -
they O -
may O -
thump O -
and O -
punch O -
me O -
about O -
, O -
I O -
have O -
the O -
satisfaction O -
of O -
knowing O -
that O -
it O -
is O -
all O -
right O -
; O -
that O -
everybody B-PER (146
else I-PER 146)
is O -
one O -
way O -
or O -
other O -
served O -
in O -
much O -
the O -
same O -
way O -
-- O -
either O -
in O -
a O -
physical O -
or O -
metaphysical O -
point O -
of O -
view O -
, O -
that O -
is O -
; O -
and O -
so O -
the O -
universal O -
thump O -
is O -
passed O -
round O -
, O -
and O -
all O -
hands O -
should O -
rub O -
each O -
other O -
's O -
shoulder-blades O -
, O -
and O -
be O -
content O -
. O -

Again O -
, O -
I O -
always O -
go O -
to O -
sea O -
as O -
a B-PER (148
sailor I-PER 148)
, O -
because O -
they O -
make O -
a O -
point O -
of O -
paying O -
me O -
for O -
my O -
trouble O -
, O -
whereas O -
they O -
never O -
pay O -
passengers B-PER (149)
a O -
single O -
penny O -
that O -
I O -
ever O -
heard O -
of O -
. O -

On O -
the O -
contrary O -
, O -
passengers B-PER (150
themselves I-PER 150)|(150)
must O -
pay O -
. O -

And O -
there O -
is O -
all O -
the O -
difference O -
in O -
the O -
world O -
between O -
paying O -
and O -
being O -
paid O -
. O -

The O -
act O -
of O -
paying O -
is O -
perhaps O -
the O -
most O -
uncomfortable O -
infliction O -
that O -
the B-PER (151
two I-PER -
orchard I-PER -
thieves I-PER -
entailed I-PER -
upon I-PER -
us I-PER 151)|(152)
. O -

But O -
being O -
paid O -
, O -
-- O -
what O -
will O -
compare O -
with O -
it O -
? O -

The O -
urbane O -
activity O -
with O -
which O -
a B-PER (153
man I-PER 153)
receives O -
money O -
is O -
really O -
marvellous O -
, O -
considering O -
that O -
we O -
so O -
earnestly O -
believe O -
money O -
to O -
be O -
the O -
root O -
of O -
all O -
earthly O -
ills O -
, O -
and O -
that O -
on O -
no O -
account O -
can O -
a B-PER (155
monied I-PER -
man I-PER 155)
enter O -
heaven O -
. O -

Ah O -
! O -

how O -
cheerfully O -
we O -
consign O -
ourselves O -
to O -
perdition O -
! O -

Finally O -
, O -
I O -
always O -
go O -
to O -
sea O -
as O -
a B-PER (159
sailor I-PER 159)
, O -
because O -
of O -
the O -
wholesome O -
exercise O -
and O -
pure O -
air O -
of O -
the O -
fore-castle O -
deck O -
. O -

For O -
as O -
in O -
this O -
world O -
, O -
head O -
winds O -
are O -
far O -
more O -
prevalent O -
than O -
winds O -
from O -
astern O -
( O -
that O -
is O -
, O -
if O -
you O -
never O -
violate O -
the O -
Pythagorean O -
maxim O -
) O -
, O -
so O -
for O -
the O -
most O -
part O -
the B-PER (161
Commodore I-PER -
on I-PER -
the I-PER -
quarter-deck I-PER 161)
gets O -
his O -
atmosphere O -
at O -
second O -
hand O -
from O -
the B-PER (162
sailors I-PER -
on I-PER -
the I-PER -

. O -

He O -
thinks O -
he O -
breathes O -
it O -
first O -
; O -
but O -
not O -
so O -
. O -

In O -
much O -
the O -
same O -
way O -
do O -
the O -
commonalty O -
lead O -
their B-PER (161|(162)
leaders I-PER 161)
in O -
many O -
other O -
things O -
, O -
at O -
the O -
same O -
time O -
that O -
the O -
leaders O -
little O -
suspect O -
it O -
. O -

But O -
wherefore O -
it O -
was O -
that O -
after O -
having O -
repeatedly O -
smelt O -
the O -
sea O -
as O -
a B-PER (164
merchant I-PER -
sailor I-PER 164)
, O -
I O -
should O -
now O -
take O -
it O -
into O -
my O -
head O -
to O -
go O -
on O -
a O -
whaling O -
voyage O -
; O -
this O -
the B-PER (165
invisible I-PER -

, O -
who O -
has O -
the O -
constant O -
surveillance O -
of O -
me O -
, O -
and O -
secretly O -
dogs O -
me O -
, O -
and O -
influences O -
me O -
in O -
some O -
unaccountable O -
way O -
-- O -
he O -
can O -
better O -
answer O -
than O -
any B-PER (166

. O -

And O -
, O -
doubtless O -
, O -
my O -
going O -
on O -
this O -
whaling O -
voyage O -
, O -
formed O -
part O -
of O -
the O -
grand O -
programme O -
of O -
Providence O -
that O -

I O -
take O -
it O -
that O -
